<dd> <p>CMUCL has a faster unicode reader now.  Tests show that the
CMUCL can process utf8 streams upto two times faster.  A serious bug
in SSE2 support has been fixed.  (The sum or difference of a complex
and a float would sometimes produce an incorrect imaginary part.)

<dd> <p><strong>CMUCL 20a patch 000</strong> A serious bug in the
printer was found in the Unicode builds.  The bug caused '|\||
(vertical bar) and '|`| (backquote) to be printed without escapes.
This <a
href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/release/20a/patches/cmucl-20a-patch-000.tar.gz">patch</a>
can be used to fix this issue.  Of course, the next snapshot will have
this issue fixed too.  See <a href="install.html">Install</a> for
instructions on how to apply a patch.</p>

<dt>2009-09-30</dt>
<dd> <p><strong>CMUCL 20a is released</strong>.  The <a
href="release-20a.txt">release notes</a> and binaries for the supported
platforms are available from the <tt>release/20a</tt>
directory of the <a href="../download.html">download</a> sites.  Due
to the 20a release, no snapshots are available for 2009-10.</p>

<dt>2009-09</dt>
<dd> <p>CMUCL 20a pre-release 1 is available.</p>

<dt>2009-05</dt>
<dd><p>The first builds with Unicode support are available.  These builds
have support for Unicode that is mostly working.</p>

<dt>2009-03</dt>
<dd><p><strong>CMUCL 19f has been released</strong>.  The <a
href="release-19f.txt">release notes</a> and binaries for the
supported platforms are available from the <tt>release/19f</tt>
directory of the <a href="../download.html">download</a> sites.  Due
to the 19f release, no snapshots are available for 2009-03.</p>

<dt>2009-02-09</dt>
<dd> <p>The <strong>Feburary snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots/2009-02</tt> directory of the download sites.</p>

<dt>2009-01-09</dt>
<dd> <p>The <strong>January snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots/2009-01</tt> directory of the download sites.</p>

<p> These snapshots include support for X87 and SSE2. CMUCL will
automatically detect if the chip supports SSE2 or not. If so, the SSE2 core
will be used. If not, the X87 (legacy) core will be used. For special
cases, the user may override this automatic selection by using the
<em>-fpu</em> flag. The SSE2 core should work somewhat better than the
X87 core on chips that support both. In particular some round-off issues
are gone, and complex arithmetic with SSE2 is faster and sometimes much
faster than X87.</p>

<dd> Fred Lakin, a long-time CMUCL user, has written a novel called <a href =
"http://www.livegraphicsnightly.com">Live Graphics Nightly</a>. How does
this relate to CMUCL? He has a nice acknowledgement to all of the CMUCL
implementors and maintainers.
