@cmucl{} includes a partial implementation of @emph{Simple Streams}, a
protocol that allows user-extensible streams@footnote{This
implementation was donated by Paul Foley}. The protocol was proposed
by Franz, Inc. and is intended to replace the @emph{Gray Streams}
method of extending streams. Simple streams are distributed as a
@cmucl{} subsystem, that can be loaded into the image by saying

@lisp
   (require :simple-streams)
@end lisp

Note that @cmucl{} implementation of simple streams is incomplete, and
in particular is currently missing support for the functions
@code{read-sequence} and @code{write-sequence}. Please consult the
@i{Allegro Common Lisp} documentation for more information on
simple streams.
