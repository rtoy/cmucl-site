@@HEADING(a high-performance, free Common Lisp implementation)

<p> CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
    which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
    Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features: </p>

<ul>
<li> Support for static arrays that are never moved by GC but are
properly removed when no longer referenced. </li>

<li> Unicode support, including many of the most common external
formats such as UTF-8 and support for handling Unix, DOS, and Mac
end-of-line schemes. </li>

<li> native double-double floats including complex double-double
floats and specialized arrays for double-double floats and and complex
double-double floats that give approximately 106 bits (32 digits) of
precision. </li>

<li> a <strong>sophisticated native-code compiler</strong> which is capable
     of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed
     with C compilers. </li>

<li> generational garbage collection and <strong>multiprocessing
     capability</strong> on the x86 ports. </li>

<li> a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and
     system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and
     direct access to Unix system calls. </li>

<li> support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
     calls. </li>

<li> an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
     includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol. </li>

<li> a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
     code profiler. </li>

<li> an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
     graphical widget library (Garnet). </li>

<li> programmer-extensible input and output streams. </li>

<li> an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp. </li>

<li> <strong>freely redistributable</strong>: free, with full source code
     (most of which is in the public domain) and no strings attached (and
     no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating systems, CMUCL is
     maintained and improved by a team of volunteers collaborating over the
     Internet. </li>

</ul>

  <ul>
   <li> FROUND is much faster for single and double float numbers.
   This is available everywhere, except for x87 (due to potential
   roundoff errors.) </li>
   <li> CMUCL no longer segfaults on Linux when running on a kernel
      without COMPAT_BRK.  CMUCL will set the personality
      appropriately and re-exec itself.</li>
   <li> GET-MACRO-CHARACTER would return the wrong second value because
      *READTABLE* was always being used instead of the specified
      readtable. </li>
   <li> COMPILE-FILE was generating an error when compiling COMPILE
      forms.  This is fixed.</li>
   <li> A critical bug in SSE2 support has been fixed.  Multiplying a
      complex single-float by a single-float produced the wrong
      result. </li>
   <li> Fix issue where CMUCL does not correctly handle FLETs in
      DEFMETHOD bodies which use the same name as that of the generic
      function.   The generic function was called instead of the local
      function.</li>
   <li> CMUCL would fail to compile external formats if *readtable* was
      not the standard readtable.  This is fixed by binding
      *readtable* to the standard readtable before compiling the
      external format.</li>
   <li> The debugger help messages is updated to reflect the actual
      implementation.  In particular L and PP have been updated, and help
      for the DESCRIBE command has been added</li>
  </ul>

<h2>What is Common Lisp?</h2>

<p> Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and
    <em>explorative programming</em>. The language has a dynamic
    semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada.
    It features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental
    development environment, a module system, a large number of
    powerful data structures, a large standard library of useful
    functions, a sophisticated object system supporting multiple
    inheritance and generic functions, an exception system,
    user-defined types and a macro system which allows programmers to
    extend the language. </p>

Pascal is for building pyramids -- imposing, breathtaking
structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp
is for building organisms ... <br> <i>Alan Perlis</i>
