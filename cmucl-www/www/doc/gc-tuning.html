          <strong>Documentation</strong>: Understanding the garbage collector
        </div><!-- FIXME add from http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc/ -->
        <p>
          The garbage collector (or GC) is the component of the CMUCL runtime
          that is responsible for recycling dynamically allocated memory. The
          GC traverses the lisp heap, starting from the <i>roots</i> (global
          variables, contents of the lisp stack, contents of the register file)
          and follows references to identify objects that are reachable. The
          memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable (called
          <i>garbage</i>) is made available for reuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          When CMUCL is started, the runtime reserves a number of contiguous
          regions of address space for the lisp heap. The lisp heap is divided
          into dynamic, static and read-only spaces. The size of these spaces
          is fixed on startup (which is why CMUCL looks like it uses a huge
          amount of memory right after being started -- in fact it is just
          reserving address space, and will only use the memory if necessary).
          The size of the dynamic space can be set by the
          <code>-dynamic-space-size</code> commandline option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Newly created objects (both code and data) are allocated in the
          dynamic space. They may be moved to static or read-only space by the
          function <code class="function-name">purify</code> (that is run when
          you save a new lisp heap). The garbage collector only scans dynamic
          space.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Precise and conservative collectors
        </h2>
        <p>
          On platforms other than x86, CMUCL uses a <strong>precise
          collector</strong>. This means that when tracing references through
          memory to determine which objects are not reachable from the roots,
          it is able to determine exactly which objects are not reachable (and
          thus available for reuse).
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, CMUCL uses a <strong>conservative collector</strong> on
          x86 platforms. This means that when tracing references through memory
          the GC is not always able to determine whether a given memory
          location contains a reference (which it should follow for
          reachability analysis), or just data (which it shouldn't follow). In
          these situations where the GC cannot decide, it is cautious (or
          <i>conservative</i>) and assumes that the location contains a
          reference. This means that in some cases the conservative GC is
          unable to reclaim storage that is actually garbage, which leads to
          wasted memory. However, this leakage is often only temporary, since
          the register or the stack location that was mis-interpreted will
          likely be overwritten by the execution of the program. Experience
          shows that this "leakage" is rarely a significant problem in most
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why use a conservative collector given its disadvantages over a
          precise collector? On platforms that use a precise garbage collector,
          CMUCL partitions the register file into descriptor registers (which
          contain references to lisp objects) and non-descriptor registers
          (containing machine integers, untagged fixnums, characters, etc).
          This means that when a garbage collection occurs, it knows exactly
          which registers should be included as roots of the reachability
          analysis. Furthermore, the lisp stack (containing call frames) is
          separate from the C stack (containing foreign frames, signal handler
          contexts, etc), so the scan of the stack for roots can be done
          exactly. The x86 platform has such a pitiful number of available
          registers that it would be unreasonable to partition the register
          file in this way; this is why a conservative collector is used.
          Furthermore, on x86 platforms the lisp stack is shared with the C
          stack, so the stack must also be scavenged conservatively.
        </p>

          <h3>
            Technical detail: descriptor and non-descriptor registers
          </h3>
          <p>
            On non-x86 platforms the garbage collector classifies values into
            three categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>pointer descriptor objects such as FunctionPointer,
            ListPointer, InstancePointer, OtherPointer, that have low tags in
            (#b001 #b011 #b101 #b111). These objects can be kept in a
            descriptor register, because they are fully tagged. In fact, they
            <em>must</em> be kept in a descriptor register, because the
            collector needs to see and modify them (when the collector moves an
            object, it must update any pointers to that object).
            </li>
            <li>immediate descriptor objects, such as odd and even fixnums,
            OtherImmediate. These objects can be kept in descriptor registers,
            because the collector won't think that they are pointer references.
            They can also be kept in non-descriptor registers, because nothing
            bad will happen if the collector sees them (the collector can
            distinguish them from lisp-pointers by looking at their tag).
            </li>
            <li>non-descriptor objects such as machine-word-sized integers,
            untagged characters, unboxed system-area-pointers, unboxed
            single-floats and double-floats. These objects can't be kept in a
            descriptor register, because doing so might confuse the collector.

        <h2>
          The generational collector
        </h2>
        <p>
          On non-x86 platforms, CMUCL uses a two-space stop-and-copy collector
          based on the Cheney algorithm. The collector is triggered after a
          certain amount of allocation, and interrupts the lisp application
          until the garbage collection has terminated. During a collection, the
          garbage collector examines the lisp heap, walking objects from the
          roots. It copies reachable objects from the current memory space to
          the newspace, making the necessary pointer corrections so that
          references to an object remain valid once is has been copied to its
          new location.
        </p>
        <p>
          On x86 platforms CMUCL uses a <strong>generational mostly-copying
          collector</strong>, which is signalled by the presence of
          <code>:gencgc</code> on the <code class="variable">*features*</code>
          list. A generational (or <i>generation-scavenging</i>) collector
          partitions the lisp heap according to the age of objects, and focuses
          its attention on younger objects. New objects are allocated in the
          youngest generation (often called the <i>nursery</i>), and are
          promoted to an older generation each time they survive a garbage
          collection. In an application where most allocated objects are
          short-lived (which is the case in many applications), a generational
          collector is efficient because most garbage collections only examine
          a portion of the lisp heap (it saves time by ignoring older objects),
          and because the spatial locality of objects in the nursery can
          improve cache use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The garbage collector performs a collection when generation 0 is
          full. It starts by examining the objects in generation 0. Reachable
          objects are promoted to generation 1. If the collection of generation
          0 did not release sufficient memory, generation 1 is collected, and
          so on until generation number 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CMUCL generational collector is "mostly-copying". An object that
          has an ambiguous reference (where the conservative nature of the
          collector means that it's unsure whether a memory location contains a
          reference) is said to be <i>pinned</i> in place; they are promoted
          in-place to the oldspace generation. The granularity of age
          annotation is a page, and a page stays in place (isn't copied) if it
          contains a pinned object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collector treats large objects (such as large arrays) specially,
          for efficiency. [FIXME expand] The generational collector is able to
          use the page protection mechanisms of the MMU to avoid scavenging
          pages that don't contain pointers to younger generations.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Triggering a garbage collection
        </h2>
        <p>
          Execution of the garbage collector will automatically be triggered
          once a certain number of megabytes have been allocated. Before trying
          to analyze the memory usage of your application, it may be useful
          explicitly to trigger a garbage collection. This can be done by
          calling the CMUCL function <code class="function-name">ext:gc</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The generational collector normally carries out only partial
          collections (it scans a subset of all the generations). This may lead
          to long-lived objects that become garbage taking a long time to be
          reclaimed. In order to force a full garbage collection, use
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
   (gc :full t)
</pre>
        <p>
          The <code>:full</code> keyword argument is only available when the
          generational collector is present.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Analyzing memory usage
        </h2>
        <p>
          The standard Common Lisp function <code class=
          "function-name">room</code> provides information on the status of
          memory allocation. It provides information such as:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
   Dynamic Space Usage:     5,851,432 bytes.
   Read-Only Space Usage:  18,408,744 bytes.
   Static Space Usage:      2,311,240 bytes.
   Control Stack Usage:           452 bytes.
   Binding Stack Usage:            96 bytes.
   The current dynamic space is 0.
   Garbage collection is currently enabled.
</pre>
        <p>
          With a second argument of <code>T</code>, it prints additional
          information, including the number of objects of each type that are
          present in the lisp heap. This can be useful to know what class of
          data structures are filling up the heap. If you suspect that the
          garbage collector is forgetting to reclaim certain objects, you may
          be interested in reading the page <a href=
          "analyze-memory-usage.html">analyzing memory usage</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the <code class="function-name">room</code> function only
          displays information on the lisp heap; it does not tell you about
          allocations in foreign space (objects allocated via the foreign
          function interface, for example using <code>malloc()</code> from C).
          You will need to use tools from your operating system (such as
          analyzing the contents of the file
          <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code> on Linux).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Tuning the garbage collector
        </h2>
        <p>
          While the CMUCL garbage collector functions reasonably well in
          general, for certain applications it may be useful to fiddle with
          various parameters.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The variable <code class=
          "variable">ext:*bytes-consed-between-gcs*</code> determines the
          number of bytes of allocation that will trigger a garbage collection.
          A lower number will trigger the garbage collector more frequently,
          but each collection will take less time; this is good for interactive
          applications where response time is important. A higher value will
          cause fewer garbage collections, and should decrease the overall time
          spent in GC. A useful idiom is to increase this value around code
          where you will be allocating large amounts of memory, as follows:
            <pre class="code">
   (let ((ext:*bytes-consed-between-gcs*
           (* ext:*bytes-consed-between-gcs* 5)))
      ;; ... lots of allocation ...
      )
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>The macro <code class="function-name">sys:without-gcing</code>
          allows you to execute forms with the garbage collector disabled.
          </li>
          <li>Use the function <code class="function-name">ext:save-lisp</code>
          with the purify option enabled, in order to move code and data to
          static space. This will improve your application's GC
          characteristics, because the static and read-only spaces are not
          scanned by the garbage collector.
          </li>
          <li>The variable <code class="variable">ext:*gc-verbose*</code> can
          be used to disable the status messages that are printed by the
          garbage collector. This may give the illusion of reducing GC
          overhead.
            <pre class="example">
; [GC threshold exceeded with 20,168 bytes in use.  Commencing GC.]
; [GC completed with 22,128 bytes retained and -1,960 bytes freed.]
; [GC will next occur when at least 25,022,128 bytes are in use.]
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>The alien variable <code class="variable">gencgc_verbose</code>
          can be set to 1 or 2 in order to print extra information concerning
          the functioning of the generational collector. This prints
          information like the following, showing the status of each
          generation.

          <li>The function <code class=
          "function-name">sys:scrub-control-stack</code> can be used to zero
          the unused portion of the control stack. This avoids old objects
          being kept alive due to a reference from an uninitialized variable on
          the control stack.

          <li>The foreign variable <code>gencgc_oldest_gen_to_gc</code>
          determines the oldeest generation that will be subject to garbage
          collection by default (in partial collections). The default value
          enables GC on all generations. Setting this variable to 0 effectively
          disables the generational nature of the collector. In some
          applications, generational GC may not be useful, because there are no
          long-lived objects. An intermediate value (between 0 and 6) may be
          appropriate after moving long-lived data into an older generation, in
          order to avoid an unnecessary GC of this long-lived data.
