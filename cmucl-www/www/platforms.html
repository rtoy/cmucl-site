@@HEADING(what does it run on?)

<p> CMUCL should work on the following combinations of operating system and
    architecture:

<dl>
<dt> Linux/x86 </dt>

<dd> The 19a release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The binaries are compiled against version 2.1 of the GNU C Library
     (glibc2.1), but also work with glibc2.2 and glibc2.3. The runtime
     support for the CMUCL Motif interface is dynamically linked, so you
     will need the Motif or Lesstif libraries installed on your system to
     use it. The binaries should run with any Linux kernel after 2.0 (but
     beware early kernels in the 2.4 series, which had poor virtual memory
     characteristics).

     <p> There are problems running CMUCL on certain kernels that are built
     with address-space randomization techniques, such as certain Fedora
     kernels. If you run into problems, please use a vanilla kernel.

     <p> There are known problems running CMUCL on 2.4 kernels using certain
     configurations of the HIGHMEM support (this option allows larger
     process address spaces, and certain distributions ship kernels with
     these patches enabled). The <tt>CONFIG_64GB</tt> and
     <tt>CONFIG_1GB</tt> options work fine.

     <p> CMUCL is known not to run under libsafe, whose system call
     interposition mechanism interferes with the foreign function
     interface. CMUCL does not run on kernels with &quot;hardening&quot;
     patches such as grsecurity, since their all-the-world-is-C
     assumptions are too strong.
</dd>

<dt> FreeBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> The 19a release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The 19a binaries should work with FreeBSD releases 4.x and
     -current (5.x). </dd>

<dt> OpenBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> There are currently no 19a binaries for OpenBSD (it seems that address
     space randomization techniques introduced with recent versions of
     OpenBSD interfere with CMUCL's memory management). The 18e release
     binaries should work on any i486 or better processor. The 18e binaries
     were build on OpenBSD 3.1. </dd>

<dt> NetBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> there are binaries for NetBSD 1.5.2 in the <tt>experimental</tt>
     directory of the download sites. Unfortunately NetBSD doesn't provide
     access to the faulting memory address in SIGSEGV handlers, hence the
     generational GC can't use a hardware-based write-barrier in order to
     reduce the need to track pointers from older generations to newer
     ones, resulting in degraded GC performance. Also, the runtime has to
     work around a limitation in the <tt>mmap</tt> system call, which
     refuses to map zones larger than 128MiB.  </dd>

<dt> Solaris/SPARC </dt>

<dd> the 19a binaries should work with SunOS 5.5 or later (also known
     respectively as Solaris 2.5, Solaris 7 and later). They require an
     UltraSPARC processor. If you have an ancient SPARC machine, you can
     get the non-v9 version of the 18e release. If you have an UltraSPARC
     the command <tt>uname&nbsp;-m</tt> will say <tt>sun4u</tt>, if you
     have an older machine such as a SparcStation it will probably say
     <tt>sun4m</tt>.

     <p> Two sets of binaries are available for 19a, one with the
     traditional stop-and-copy garbage collector (tarballs with
     <tt>cheney-gc</tt> in the filename), and another with a generational
     collector (tarballs with <tt>gencgc</tt> in the filename). FASL files
     from the two versions are incompatible. </dd>

<dt> Alpha/Linux </dt>
<dd> There are no 19a binaries for Alpha. The 18e binaries are known to
     work on ev56 and ev6 machines, running Linux 2.4.x. </dd>

<dt> IRIX/MIPS </dt>
<dd> There are no 19a binaries for IRIX. The 18e release binaries are known
     to work with Irix 6.2, and should work on any later version. They use
     the o32 ABI. </dd>

<dt> HPUX/HPPA </dt>
<dd> this port has not been maintained for quite a while, so
     you'll have to go back to the 18a release to find binaries for this
     platform. </dd>

<dt> PowerPC/MacOS X </dt>
<dd> CMUCL has an experimental port to this platform. Binaries are
     available from <a href = "http://www.pmsf.de/personal/darwin/">Pierre
     Mai's page</a>.  </dd>

<dt> x86/win32 </dt>
<dd> There is an ongoing effort to port CMUCL to win32. </dd>
</dl>


<p> The <a href = "http://sbcl.sf.net/">SBCL implementation</a> (a fork
    from CMUCL) runs on some platforms that CMUCL doesn't currently
    support, such as Linux/SPARC, Linux/PowerPC, Linux/Alpha -- check their
    web site for current status. </p>


<h3>Platform-specific build options</h3>

<p> The builds for x86 platforms include a generational conservative
garbage collector (this can be tested for through the presence of the
<tt>:gencgc</tt> feature). The other architectures use a stop-and-copy
garbage collector. </p>

<p> The x86 builds also include basic multiprocessing support (this can be
tested for through the presence of the <tt>:mp</tt> feature). The
implementation is based on stack groups, ie user-level threads, and not on
kernel threads. The interface is very similar to the <a href =
"http://www.mikemac.com/mike/clim/clim-sys.html">CLIM-SYS
specification</a>. </p>
