          <strong>Home</strong>: a high-performance, free Common Lisp
          implementation
        </div>
        <p>
          CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming
          language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms
          to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main
          features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support for static arrays that are never moved by GC but are
          properly removed when no longer referenced.
          </li>
          <li>Unicode support, including many of the most common external
          formats such as UTF-8 and support for handling Unix, DOS, and Mac
          end-of-line schemes.
          </li>
          <li>native double-double floats including complex double-double
          floats and specialized arrays for double-double floats and and
          complex double-double floats that give approximately 106 bits (32
          digits) of precision.
          </li>
          <li>a <strong>sophisticated native-code compiler</strong> which is
          capable of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive
          in speed with C compilers.
          </li>
          <li>generational garbage collection and <strong>multiprocessing
          capability</strong> on the x86 ports.
          </li>
          <li>a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code
          and system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms,
          and direct access to Unix system calls.
          </li>
          <li>support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
          calls.
          </li>
          <li>an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
          includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol.
          </li>
          <li>a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
          code profiler.
          </li>
          <li>an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
          graphical widget library (Garnet).
          </li>
          <li>programmer-extensible input and output streams.
          </li>
          <li>an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>freely redistributable</strong>: free, with full source
            code (most of which is in the public domain) and no strings
            attached (and no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating
            systems, CMUCL is maintained and improved by a team of volunteers
            collaborating over the Internet.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          What is Common Lisp?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and
          <em>explorative programming</em>. The language has a dynamic
          semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada. It
          features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental
          development environment, a module system, a large number of powerful
          data structures, a large standard library of useful functions, a
          sophisticated object system supporting multiple inheritance and
          generic functions, an exception system, user-defined types and a
          macro system which allows programmers to extend the language.
