@@HEADING(a high-performance, free Common Lisp implementation)

<p> CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
    which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
    Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features: </p>

<ul>
<li> Support for static arrays that are never moved by GC but are
properly removed when no longer referenced. </li>

<li> Unicode support, including many of the most common external
formats such as UTF-8 and support for handling Unix, DOS, and Mac
end-of-line schemes. </li>

<li> native double-double floats including complex double-double
floats and specialized arrays for double-double floats and and complex
double-double floats that give approximately 106 bits (32 digits) of
precision. </li>

<li> a <strong>sophisticated native-code compiler</strong> which is capable
     of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed
     with C compilers. </li>

<li> generational garbage collection and <strong>multiprocessing
     capability</strong> on the x86 ports. </li>

<li> a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and
     system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and
     direct access to Unix system calls. </li>

<li> support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
     calls. </li>

<li> an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
     includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol. </li>

<li> a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
     code profiler. </li>

<li> an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
     graphical widget library (Garnet). </li>

<li> programmer-extensible input and output streams. </li>

<li> an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp. </li>

<li> <strong>freely redistributable</strong>: free, with full source code
     (most of which is in the public domain) and no strings attached (and
     no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating systems, CMUCL is
     maintained and improved by a team of volunteers collaborating over the
     Internet. </li>

</ul>

<dt>2010-08 snapshot and 20b prerelease 1</dt>
<dd><p>
 CMUCL 20b prelease 1 has been released, in preparation for the
 upcoming 20b release.  Therefore there will not
 be a 2010-08 snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> <p>Error handling has been added to external formats.  Previously,
      all external formats would silently replace bad encodings with a
      suitable replacement character.  Now, the user can specify how
      the errors are handled by using the <tt>:DECODING-ERROR</tt> and
      <tt>:ENCODING-ERROR</tt> parameters to <tt>OPEN</tt>.  The default is the previous
      behavior.</p>
	    
      <p>For decoding-error, a character, symbol, or function
      can be given.  If a character, then that character is used as
      the replacement character.  For a symbol or function, it must be
      a function of 3 arguments:  a message string, the offending
      octet (or nil), and the number of octets read in the encoding.
      If the function returns, it must be the codepoint of the desired
      replacement.</p>

      <p>For encoding-error, a character, symbol, or function can be
      given.  If a character, then that character is used as the
      replacement character.  For a symbol or function, it must be a
      function of 2 arguments: a message string and the offending
      codepoint.  If the function returns, it must be the codepoint of
      the desired replacement.</p>
    </li>
    <li> Add <tt>EXT:LIST-ALL-EXTERNAL-FORMATS</tt> to list all known external
      formats and their aliases.
    </li>
    <li> ADD <tt>EXT:DESCRIBE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</tt> to print a description of the
      specified exernal format.  To support this, the macros
      <tt>DEFINE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</tt> and <tt>DEFINE-COMPOSING-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</tt> have
      changed.
    </li>
    <li> The sparc port now supports the :executable feature.</li>
    <li> The Mac OS X port now support the :executable feature.</li>
    <li> A critical bug in the fast unicode stream buffering routine has
      been fixed.  This bug manifests itself by causing valid
      sequences to be incorrectly decoded, resulting in a replacement
      character.
    <li> UTF-8 correctly catches overlong sequences now.  Previously,
      overlong sequences were missed.
    <li> When UTF-8 decoder encounters an overlong sequence, a surrogate
      code point, or a too-large codepoint, the entire sequence is
      converted to the replacement character.  Previously, all of the
      octets except the first were put back, and the data read again.
    <li> Some GC improvements for sparc and ppc.  (Changes for ppc
      untested).  GC could incorrectly move the PC and other
      registers, causing a segfault.
    <li> A bug inadvertently introduced in the 2010-04 non-unicode
      snapshot has been fixed.  The bug prevented the non-unicode
      versions of CMUCL from loading the external format aliases
      file. 
    <li> With SSE2, the imaginary part of a (complex single-float) is now
      returned correctly.
    <li> The method used to create executable images for Linux has been
      cleaned up and should be far more robust against different
      versions of the OS.  The same is true on sparc as well as Mac OS
      X.

<h2>What is Common Lisp?</h2>

<p> Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and
    <em>explorative programming</em>. The language has a dynamic
    semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada.
    It features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental
    development environment, a module system, a large number of
    powerful data structures, a large standard library of useful
    functions, a sophisticated object system supporting multiple
    inheritance and generic functions, an exception system,
    user-defined types and a macro system which allows programmers to
    extend the language. </p>
