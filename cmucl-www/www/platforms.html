          <strong>Platforms</strong>: what does it run on?
        </div>
        <p>
          The current release of CMUCL should work on the following
          combinations of operating system and architecture:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Linux/x86
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 19f release should work on any i586 or better processor. If the
            processor supports SSE2, CMUCL will automatically detect that and
            use SSE2. Otherwise the legacy x87 support will be used.
            <p>
              The 19e release binaries should work on any i586 or better
              processor. The binaries are compiled against version 2.2 of the
              GNU C Library (glibc2.2), but also work with glibc2.3. The
              runtime support for the CMUCL Motif interface is dynamically
              linked, so you will need the Motif or Lesstif libraries
              (preferably version 2) installed on your system to use it. The
              binaries should run with any Linux kernel after 2.0 (but beware
              early kernels in the 2.4 series, which had poor virtual memory
              characteristics).
            </p>
            <p>
              There are problems running CMUCL on certain kernels that are
              built with address-space randomization techniques, such as
              certain Fedora kernels. If you run into problems, please use a
              vanilla kernel.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are known problems running CMUCL on 2.4 kernels using
              certain configurations of the HIGHMEM support (this option allows
              larger process address spaces, and certain distributions ship
              kernels with these patches enabled). The <code>CONFIG_64GB</code>
              and <code>CONFIG_1GB</code> options work fine.
            </p>
            <p>
              CMUCL is known not to run under libsafe, whose system call
              interposition mechanism interferes with the foreign function
              interface. CMUCL does not run on kernels with "hardening" patches
              such as grsecurity, since their all-the-world-is-C assumptions
              are too strong.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Darwin/x86
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The 20a release binaries were built on MacOSX 10.5 (Leopard) and
              probably require 10.5 or later.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 19f release binaries should work on any processor supported
              by MacOS X (x86). They require 10.4 (Tiger) or later.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            FreeBSD/i386 and amd64
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 19e release binaries have been built on the i386 architecture,
            on which they will, of course, work; they will also work, with
            proper i386 compatibility library installed, on the amd64
            architecture. New binaries can't be at this point built on the
            amd64 architecture, though -- i386 binaries should be used there.
            <p>
              Notice that the architecture in question is the OS architecture
              ("target"), not the processor's one -- FreeBSD/i386 running on an
              amd64 processor is good for all CMUCL purposes, including
              building new binaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              An appropriately chosen distibution (e.g.
              `cmucl-19e-x86-freebsd7.0.*', for FreeBSD 7.0) should work on
              FreeBSD 6.3, 7.0 and 8.0. Using a "later" FreeBSD distribution on
              an "earlier" FreeBSD release (e.g. `cmucl-19e-x86-freebsd7.0.*'
              on FreeBSD 6.3) is either not possible or not tested. Using an
              "earlier" FreeBSD distribution on a "later" FreeBSD release
              should be possible with appropriate compatibility libraries
              installed but has not be tested and is advised against --- use
              the binaries built on the OS release they are going to run on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legacy FreeBSD releases (earlier than 6.3) have not been tested
              as runtime platforms and will be not supported, although the 6.3
              distribution may run on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              FreeBSD 6 will be not supported after CMUCL release 19e.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Solaris/SPARC
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The 19f binaries should work with Solaris 8 or later (also known
              as Solaris 2.8). They require an UltraSPARC processor. If you
              have an ancient SPARC machine, you can get the non-v9 version of
              the 18e release. If you have an UltraSPARC the command
              <code>uname&nbsp;-m</code> will say <code>sun4u</code>, if you
              have an older machine such as a SparcStation it will probably say
              <code>sun4m</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that starting with the 2010-02 snapshot, Solaris 8 builds
              are being dropped in favor of Solaris 10 builds. The Solaris 10
              builds will not run on Solaris 8, but Solaris 8 builds will run
              just fine on Solaris 10. However, Solaris 8 builds may be
              available.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            NetBSD/x86
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 19c release binaries should work on any i586 or better
            processor. The 19c binaries should work with NetBSD releases xx and
            yy.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The following platforms are not supported by the current CMUCL
          release, but were supported by previous releases:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Darwin/ppc
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 19f release binaries work with MacOS X version 10.4. For older
            versions of MacOS X, use the 19c binaries. No developer has access
            to a ppc running MacOS X anymore.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            OpenBSD/x86
          </dt>
          <dd>
            There are currently no 19c binaries for OpenBSD (it seems that
            address space randomization techniques introduced with recent
            versions of OpenBSD interfere with CMUCL's memory management). The
            18e release binaries should work on any i486 or better processor.
            The 18e binaries were build on OpenBSD 3.1.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Alpha/Linux
          </dt>
          <dd>
            There are no 19c binaries for Alpha. The 18e binaries are known to
            work on ev56 and ev6 machines, running Linux 2.4.x.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            IRIX/MIPS
          </dt>
          <dd>
            There are no 19c binaries for IRIX. The 18e release binaries are
            known to work with Irix 6.2, and should work on any later version.
            They use the o32 ABI.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            HPUX/HPPA
          </dt>
          <dd>
            this port has not been maintained for quite a while, so you'll have
            to go back to the 18a release to find binaries for this platform.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://sbcl.sf.net/">SBCL implementation</a> (a fork
          from CMUCL) runs on some platforms that CMUCL doesn't currently
          support, such as Linux/SPARC, Linux/PowerPC, Linux/Alpha -- check
          their web site for current status.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Platform-specific build options
        </h3>
        <p>
          The builds for x86, sparc, and ppc platforms include a generational
          conservative garbage collector (this can be tested for through the
          presence of the <code>:gencgc</code> feature). The other
          architectures use a stop-and-copy garbage collector.
        </p>
        <p>
          The x86 builds also include basic multiprocessing support (this can
          be tested for through the presence of the <code>:mp</code> feature).
          The implementation is based on stack groups, ie user-level threads,
          and not on kernel threads. The interface is very similar to the
          <a href="http://www.mikemac.com/mike/clim/clim-sys.html">CLIM-SYS
          specification</a>.
