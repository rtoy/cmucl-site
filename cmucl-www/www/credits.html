@@HEADING(project history & who's who)

<p> CMUCL was developed at the Computer Science Department of <a href =
    "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. The work was a
    small autonomous part within the <a href =
    "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/mach/public/www/mach.html">Mach
    microkernel-based operating system project</a>, and started more as a
    tool development effort than a research project. The project started
    out as Spice Lisp, which provided a modern Lisp implementation for use
    in the CMU community. CMUCL has been under continual development since
    the early 1980's (concurrent with the Common Lisp standardization
    effort). Most of the CMU Common Lisp implementors went on to work on
    the <a href =
    "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gwydion/docs/htdocs/gwydion/">
    Gwydion environment for Dylan</a>. The CMU team was lead by <a href =
    "http://www-cgi.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/finger?sef%2B@cs.cmu.edu">Scott E.
    Fahlman</a>, the Python compiler was written by <a href =
    "http://www-cgi.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/finger?ram%2B@cs.cmu.edu">Robert
    MacLachlan</a>. </p>

<p> CMUCL's CLOS implementation is derived from the PCL reference
    implementation written an Xerox PARC. Its implementation of the LOOP
    macro was derived from code from Symbolics, which was derived from code
    written at MIT. The CLX code is copyrighted by Texas Instruments
    Incorporated. </p>

<p> CMUCL was funded by DARPA under CMU's &quot;Research on Parallel
    Computing&quot; contract. Rather than doing pure research on
    programming languages and environments, the emphasis was on developing
    practical programming tools. Sometimes this required new technology,
    but much of the work was in creating a Common Lisp environment that
    incorporates state-of-the-art features from existing systems (both Lisp
    and non-Lisp). Archives of the project are <a href =
    "ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/clisp/">available
    online</a>. </p>

<p> The project funding stopped in 1994, so support at Carnegie Mellon
    University has been discontinued. The project continues as a group
    of users and developers collaborating over the Internet. Past and
    present contributors are: </p>
