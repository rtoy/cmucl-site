          <strong>Documentation</strong>: Hints for using the PCL Metaobject
          Protocol
        </div>
        <p>
          The CLOS <strong>Metaobject Protocol</strong> (MOP) is a
          semi-standardized reflective extension to CLOS. Most Common Lisp
          implementations (including CMUCL) implement a metaobject protocol
          that is similar to the specification given in <a href=
          "http://www.lisp.org/mop/">chapters 5 and 6 of the <i>The Art of the
          MetaObject Protocol</i></a> (a book whose title is often abbreviated
          <i>AMOP</i>). However, the PCL MOP provided by CMUCL has a few
          differences from AMOP, and behaves differently from the MOP in other
          Common Lisp implementations in certain respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major issues that can arise are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure that you use symbols from the right package. A number
          of symbols, such as <code class="code">STANDARD-CLASS</code> exist
          both in the <code class="code">COMMON-LISP</code> package and in the
          <code class="code">PCL</code> package. For MOP programming you should
          be using the symbols from the PCL package.
          </li>
          <li>CMUCL has a package named <code class="code">MOP</code>, which
          exports most (but not all) of the symbols defined in AMOP.
          </li>
          <li>Since CMUCL uses special wrappers around class-objects, you
          sometimes need to use <code class=
          "function-name">PCL::COERCE-TO-PCL-CLASS</code> to coerce the wrapper
          objects into real MOP-aware objects. For example, this occurs when
          using the <code class="function-name">CLASS-OF</code> function.
          </li>
          <li>You may need to define methods on <code class=
          "function-name">PCL:VALIDATE-SUPERCLASS</code> more often than is
          said in AMOP. For example, consider a class called <code>FOO</code>
          whose metaclass is <code>META-FOO</code>. Class FOO inherits from
          class T, whose metaclass is <code>STANDARD-CLASS</code>, and in the
          PCL MOP you have to declare that this combination of metaclasses is
          valid:
            <pre class="code">
   (defmethod pcl:validate-superclass ((class meta-foo) (super pcl::standard-class))
      t)
</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Details on the class schizophrenia
        </h2>
        <p>
          PCL, the CLOS implementation that is used in CMUCL, is integrated
          with the rest of CMUCL in a somewhat incomplete way. The type system
          of PCL and of the CMUCL kernel have different notions of what a class
          is. This is because classes are fundamental to the CMUCL type system,
          yet CMUCL needs to be able to function without PCL loaded (mainly in
          order to be able to build itself). The way that this problem is
          resolved is by having the CMUCL kernel maintain parallel class
          hierarchies. For instance, <code class="code">LISP:CLASS</code> and
          <code class="code">PCL:CLASS</code> are different types. The function
          <code class="function-name">LISP:FIND-CLASS</code> returns instances
          of <code class="code">LISP:CLASS</code>, whereas the function
          <code class="function-name">PCL:FIND-CLASS</code> returns
          <code class="code">PCL:CLASS</code> instances. For example
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
   USER&gt; (lisp:find-class 'cons)
   #&lt;built-in-class cons (sealed) {28073C8D}&gt;
   USER&gt; (pcl:find-class 'cons)
   #&lt;Built-In-Class cons {2817967D}&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          These two classes are in one sense the same class, in that they
          represent the same type: CONS. However, PCL has its own way of
          representing that type internally.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make this situation livable, PCL has been hacked up to
          accept <code class="code">LISP:CLASS</code> objects in the common
          places where people supply classes to PCL operations. You can also
          explicitly convert between the two kinds of classes, either by using
          the class name and the appropriate <code class=
          "function-name">FIND-CLASS</code>, or by:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
    (kernel:class-pcl-class lisp-class)  ==&gt; the PCL class
    (kernel:layout-class (pcl::class-wrapper pcl-class))  ==&gt; the LISP class
</pre>
        <p>
          Another problem area is with generic functions that are called by PCL
          with classes as arguments. These classes will be <code class=
          "code">PCL:CLASS</code>es, so if you try to specialize on e.g.
          <code class="function-name">ALLOCATE-INSTANCE</code> using an
          <code class="function-name">EQL</code> specializer, then make sure
          the class in the specializer is a <code class=
          "code">PCL:CLASS</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who stick to using standard CLOS operations shouldn't ever
          notice all this smoke and mirrors. People using standard CLOS
          operations shouldn't have their packages use the PCL package, since
          the Common-Lisp package exports a consistent set of definitions for
          standard CLOS operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the above hacks usually work for simple stuff, they often seem
          to break down when defining new metaclasses. What you need to do is
          explictly specify the <code class="code">PCL::</code> prefix on the
          class name.
