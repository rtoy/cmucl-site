@@HEADING(a high-performance, free Common Lisp implementation)

<p> CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
    which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
    Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features: </p>

<ul>
<li> Support for static arrays that are never moved by GC but are
properly removed when no longer referenced. </li>

<li> Unicode support, including many of the most common external
formats such as UTF-8 and support for handling Unix, DOS, and Mac
end-of-line schemes. </li>

<li> native double-double floats including complex double-double
floats and specialized arrays for double-double floats and and complex
double-double floats that give approximately 106 bits (32 digits) of
precision. </li>

<li> a <strong>sophisticated native-code compiler</strong> which is capable
     of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed
     with C compilers. </li>

<li> generational garbage collection and <strong>multiprocessing
     capability</strong> on the x86 ports. </li>

<li> a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and
     system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and
     direct access to Unix system calls. </li>

<li> support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
     calls. </li>

<li> an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
     includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol. </li>

<li> a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
     code profiler. </li>

<li> an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
     graphical widget library (Garnet). </li>

<li> programmer-extensible input and output streams. </li>

<li> an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp. </li>

<li> <strong>freely redistributable</strong>: free, with full source code
     (most of which is in the public domain) and no strings attached (and
     no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating systems, CMUCL is
     maintained and improved by a team of volunteers collaborating over the
     Internet. </li>

</ul>

<dt><strong>Snapshot 2012-08</strong></dt>
 <dd> The <a
 href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/08/">2012-08 snapshot</a> has been released. See the 
   <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/08/release-20d.txt">release notes</a> 
    for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between
    the this snapshot and the previous snapshot.

  <ul>
    <li>ASDF2 updated to version 2.23.</li>
    <li>CMUCL can now be compiled correctly with clang.</li>
    <li>Fixed a possible stack corruption bug on x86 when calling from C into lisp.</li>
    <li>Support for Mac OSX 10.4 and earlier has been dropped. (Lack of developer access to such machines.) </li>
  </ul>
 </dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2012-07</dt>
 <dd> The 2012-07 snapshot has been released. See the 
   <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/07/release-20d.txt">release notes</a> 
    for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between
    the this snapshot and the previous snapshot.

  <ul>
    <li>ASDF2 updated to version 2.22.</li>
    <li>Minor internal changes to support building with clang, which doesn't yet work as expected.</li>
  </ul>
 </dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2012-06</dt>
 <dd> The 2012-06 snapshot has been released. See the 
   <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/06/release-20d.txt">release notes</a> 
    for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between
    the this snapshot and the previous snapshot.

  <ul>
    <li>Implement faster <code>LOGCOUNT</code> function on x86, if
    <code>:SSE3</code> feature is available. (Only applies to new uses
    of <code>LOGCOUNT</code>. The core uses the default version.)
    </li>

    <li>On x86, <code>SET-FLOATING-POINT-MODES</code> clears any
    current and accrued exceptions that match exceptions in
    <code>:TRAPS</code>. Previously, enabling a trap when the current
    exception also listed that trap caused the exception to be
    immediately signaled. This no longer happens and now matches how
    ppc and sparc behave. </li>
  </ul>
 </dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2012-05</dt>
 <dd> The 2012-05 snapshot has been released. See the release notes
 for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.

  <ul>
    <li> ASDF2 updated to version 2.21.</li>
    <li>Many additional aliases for external formats added that match
    the glibc iconv aliases.</li>
    <li>External format for UTF-32 was generating an error when
    converting octets to a string.</li>
    <li> The UTF-16-BE and UTF-16-LE external formats were returning
    the incorrect number of octets when surrogates pairs were
    decoded. This confuses the stream buffering code.</li>
    <li> Fix typo in ISO8859-2 external format that caused it not to
    work correctly. This type potentially also caused failures for all
    other external formats that were based on ISO8859-2.</li>
    <li> Fix <a
    href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/ticket/58">ticket:58</a>:
    UTF-16 buffering problem.</li>
  </ul>
 </dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2012-04</dt>
 <dd> The 2012-04 snapshot has been released. See the 
    <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/04/release-20d.txt">release notes</a> for
    details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
    this snapshot and the 20c release..

  <ul>
    <li>Added a new contrib, <code>contrib-packed-sse2</code> to allow packed
    operations ala SSE2. Support for some packed sse2 operations like
    multiply, divide, and shuffle for both packed singles and
    doubles. All operations are done on top of <code>(complex double-float)</code>
    numbers. Functions are provided to put and get packed
    singles/doubles from <code>(complex double-float)</code>.
    </li>

    <li>Some VOP costs were incorrect which prevented the fast complex
    double-float multiplier from being used when sse3 is available.
    </li>

    <li>Add micro-optimization for x86 (already available on sparc and
    ppc) where (logand <signed-byte 32> #xffffffff) generates a
    register move instead of and'ing with #xffffffff. 
    </li>

    <li>Updated to Unicode 6.1.0.</li>

    <li><code>LISP:UNICODE-COMPLETE</code> no longer signals an error
    if the prefix isn't a prefix of the name of any Unicode character.
    </li>

    <li>Add <code>-R</code> option to build.sh to force recompiling the C runtime. </li>

    <li>UTF-8 is now build into the core and always available.</li>

    <li>A bug in <code>UNICODE-COMPLETE-NAME</code> has been
    fixed. (Mostly useful with Slime when completing character
    names.)
    </li>

    <li>An issue with blocked signals after an interrupt has been fixed.</li>

    <li>The ppc port has been revived; only a Unicode version is currently
    available. 
    </li>

    <li>CMUCL was not printing pathnames like <code>(make-pathname :directory
    '(:absolute "tmp" "" "/"))</code> correctly. This is now printed
    using <code>#P(...)</code>. 
    </li>

    <li>The directory structure has been changed.</li>

    </li><code>ASDF2</code> updated to version 2.019.</li>

    <li>Behavior of <code>STRING-TO-OCTETS</code> has changed. This is
    an incompatible change from the previous version but should be
    more useful when a buffer is given which is not large enough to
    hold all the octets for the given string. See docstring for more
    details.
    </li>
    
    <li>DECODE-FLOAT was not correctly declared and could not be
    compiled to handle double-double-floats. 
   </li> 

  </ul>
 </dd>

<dt><strong>20c released</strong></dt>
<dd>CMUCL 20c has been released, For information on the changes between
20c and 20b, we refer the reader to the <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/wiki/ReleaseNotes20c">20c release notes</a>.

Because of the release, there will not be a 2011-11 snapshot. . 
</dd>

<dt>2011-09-20</dt>
<dd> The CMUCL CVS repository has been converted to git and is now
available. You can browse the repository using the  <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/browser">Browse
Source</a>, or you can visit <a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/cmucl/cmucl.git;a=summary;js=1">CMUCL gitweb</a> for a different view. This page
also includes links necessary for cloning the repository. (For
commiters, be sure to put your userid in the ssh link.)  

    The CVS repository will still be available, but will not allow checkins anymore.

    Git is integrated with Trac so the commit messages can refer to
    and even close Trac tickets. If the commit messages contains text
    like

<pre>
        command #1
    	command #1, #2
    	command #1 & #2
    	command #1 and #2
</pre>

    then the given command is applied to the specified
    tickets. Instead of the short-hand syntax above, you can also use

<pre>
        command ticket:1
    	command ticket:1, ticket:2
    	command ticket:1 & ticket:2
    	command ticket:1 and ticket:2
</pre>

    The available commands (not case-sensitive) are:

<dl>
 <dt> close, closed, closes, fix, fixed, fixes</dt>
 <dd> The specified issue numbers are closed with the contents of this
 commit message being added to it. </dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-09</dt>

<dd> The 2011-09 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> ASDF2 updated to version 2.017.
  <li> Improve type propagation for <code>LOAD-TIME-VALUE</code>.
  <li> Getting documentation of a structure via <code>DOCUMENTATION</code> no longer signals an error.
  <li> Reduce unnecessary consing of <code>SAP</code>s in <code>ROOM</code>.
  <li> Make stack overflow checking actually work on Mac OS X.  The
   implementation had the <code>:stack-checking</code> feature, but it didn't
   actually prevent stack overflows from crashing lisp.
  <li> Fix rounding of numbers larger than a fixnum.
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-07

<dd> The 2011-07 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> Unicode database updated to Unicode 6.0.0.</li>
  <li> ASDF2 updated to version 2.016.1</li>

  <li> Add <code>LISP:LOAD-ALL-UNICODE-DATA</code> to load all the
  unicode information into core. This is useful for creating an
  executable image that does not need unidata.bin.</li>

  <li> CMUCL no longer exits if you specify a core file with an
  executable image. A warning is printed instead and the core file is
  used.</li>

  <li> <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/ticket/43">Trac
  #43</a> has been fixed in a better way. The previous fix was
  incorrect and causes some Unicode tests to fail.</li>
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-06

<dd> The 2011-06 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> <code>:CMUCL</code> is now in <code>*FEATURES*</code>
  <li> Added command line option, <code>-unidata</code>, to allow user
  to specify the location and name of the unidata.bin file. This is
  used instead of the default location.
  <li> Opening a file with <code>:IF-EXISTS
  :NEW-VERSION</code> no longer causes an error if the file name
   contains "[".
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-05
<dd> Due to the upgrade on common-lisp.net, no snapshot is available
for this month.

<dt>Snapshot 2011-04

<dd> The 2011-04 snapshot has been released. See the release nots for
     details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
     this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> In <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>, the second return value is now non-nil if
  there are style warnings. Previously, style warnings were
  erroneously ignored. </li>
  <li> ASDF has been updated to version 2.014.1 </li>
 </ul>
</dd>
<dt>Snapshot 2011-03
<dd>
 The 2011-03 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> In <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>, the <code>:OUTPUT-FILE</code> can
    also be a stream.  CMUCL was erroneously signaling an error..</li>

  <li> <code>(OPEN f :DIRECTION :IO :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL)</code> no
    longer signals an error if the file <code>f</code> does not exist.
    It returns <code>NIL</code> now.</li>
  <li> In some situations the compiler could not constant fold <code>SQRT</code>
    calls because <code>KERNEL:%SQRT</code> was not defined on x86
    with SSE2.  This is fixed now.</li>
  <li> In an earlier snapshot to add support for character name
    completion with slime, a bug was introduced where cmucl could no
    longer read <code>#\latin_small_letter_a</code>.  This is fixed
    in this version.<li>
 </ul>
<dt>Snapshot 2011-02
<dd>
 The 2011-02 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> <code>EXT::DESCRIBE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</code> was not exported.</li>

  <li> <code>TRACE</code> was erroneously allowing encapsulation when
   tracing local flet/labels functions.  This doesn't actually trace
   anything. An error is now signaled in this case.  If you are sure,
   you can specify <code>:ENCAPSULATE NIL</code> to disable
   encapsulation.  </li>
 </ul>
</dd>
<dt>Snapshot 2011-01
<dd>
 The 2011-01 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> Initial support for Solaris/x86.  CMUCL will run on Solaris/x86
       with all features available. </li>
  <li> <code>UNINTERN</code> no longer removes the wrong symbol.  <code>UNINTERN</code> would
       remove the symbol when inherited from another package although it
       should not.
  <li> <code>DEFSTRUCT</code> allows multiple keyword constructors as required by the spec..
  </li>
  <li> <code>SUBSEQ</code> with an end index less than the start index sometimes
  crashes CMUCL. Now, signal an error if the boudns are not
  valid. 
  </li>
  <li> Localization support was causing many calls to stat trying to
  find non-existent translation files.  This has been fixed so
  that the results are cached.  (If new translations are added,
  the cache will need to be cleared or cmucl restarted.)  This
  change cuts building time by half on Solaris/sparc.
  </li>
  <li> On NetBSD, function-end breakpoints, especially for
  tail-recursive functions, are working now.
  </li>
  <li> On NetBSD, display of FP numbers (sse2 and x87) during tracing
  has been corrected.  Previously, random values were displayed.
  </li>
  <li> Executables images can now be created on NetBSD again.</li>
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt><strong>20b patch 000</strong>

<h2>What is Common Lisp?</h2>

<p> Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and
    <em>explorative programming</em>. The language has a dynamic
    semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada.
    It features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental
    development environment, a module system, a large number of
    powerful data structures, a large standard library of useful
    functions, a sophisticated object system supporting multiple
    inheritance and generic functions, an exception system,
    user-defined types and a macro system which allows programmers to
    extend the language. </p>

<blockquote>
Pascal is for building pyramids -- imposing, breathtaking
structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp
is for building organisms ... <br> <i>Alan Perlis</i>
