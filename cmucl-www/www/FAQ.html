            <b>Q</b>: Why does CMUCL say <code>Warning: Declaring foo
            special</code>?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: This happens when you have used <code class=
              "function-name">SETQ</code> on an undeclared variable at the top
              level. The default behaviour of CMUCL in this situation is to
              <a href=
              "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/d_specia.htm">
              declare the variable special</a> (transforming it from a
              lexically bound variable to a dynamically bound variable). In
              effect, when you do
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
   (setq foo 42)
</pre>and <code>foo</code> has not previously been declared (using
            <code class="function-name">DEFVAR</code> or <code class=
            "function-name">DEFPARAMETER</code> for example), CMUCL will
            implicitly do a
            <pre class="code">
   (defvar foo)
</pre>
            <p>
              for you. This is done for the user's convenience, but can lead to
              strange behaviour if you're not expecting it (since by convention
              special variables are named with surrounding *asterisks*), which
              is why CMUCL emits the warning message. Also note that there is
              no way of undoing the SPECIAL declaration, to allow purely
              lexical binding of the symbol.
            </p>
            <p>
              The variable <code class=
              "variable">ext:*top-level-auto-declare*</code> allows you to
              control this behaviour.

            <b>Q</b>: How do I compile my Lisp program to an executable?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: CMUCL does not, in general, support delivery as an
              executable. If this bothers you, note that this is also the case
              of most other programming language implementations: for example
              Sun's java implementation requires a bundle of class files.
            </p>
            <p>
              The standard way of delivering a Common Lisp application with
              CMUCL is to dump an image containing all your application code
              (see the <a href="../docs/cmu-user/html/index.html"><i>CMUCL
              User's Manual</i></a> for details), and deliver a tarball
              containing this image, the lisp runtime, and a shell script which
              launches the runtime with your image (see the
              <code>sample-wrapper</code> distributed with CMUCL for guidance).
              Also see the following <a href="doc/executable.html">hint on
              making Lisp files executable</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, on Linux and FreeBSD x86 platforms, CMUCL can actually
              produce an executable. This is done by specifying
              <code>:executable t</code> option for <code>save-lisp</code>. The
              executable file contains the current entire core image and
              runtime. See the section <em>Saving a Core Image</em> in the
              <a href="../docs/cmu-user/html/index.html"><i>CMUCL User's
              Manual</i></a> for more information.

            <b>Q</b>: Why does CMUCL say it's called Python 1.1 when it starts
            up? Isn't that the name of a scripting language?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: The CMUCL native code compiler is called Python. This
              use of the name predates the existence of that other scripting
              language.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the history of the name, Rob MacLachlan says
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Scott Fahlman said that he wanted a really smart compiler that
              would digest your program the way a Python digests a pig. It was
              a colorful metaphor for the idea of a compiler that pushed
              farther in the direction of trading compile efficiency for
              runtime efficiency. We achieved this to such a degree that the
              original <a href=
              "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Lisp">Spice</a> machine, the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERQ">Perq</a>, couldn't
              usefully run Python, though we tried it. It ran first on the IBM
              RT PC. This was cross-compiled using the previous Spice Lisp
              compiler (CLC, Common Lisp Compiler), which had a large runtime
              of assembler written by David B. Mcdonald, and the first Python
              backend used all of that assembly runtime. The first port setting
              the pattern of later ports was the MIPS port, which was largely
              done by William Lott.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Scott Fahlman says he
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              thought Python was a good name because a compiler is a long
              pipeline. A pig goes in one end, the snake goes off to rest under
              a bush for a surprisingly long time, the pipeline does its thing,
              and compact little pellet eventually comes out the other end.

            <b>Q</b>: How do I report a bug in CMUCL?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: Send an email describing the problem to the cmucl-help
              xor cmucl-imp mailing lists (see the <a href=
              "support.html">Support page</a> for more information on these
              lists). Make sure you include the version of CMUCL that you are
              using (for instance the herald that it prints on startup), the
              platform, your <code class="variable">*features*</code>. Make
              sure that the problem isn't coming from your personal or
              site-wide initialization files. Try to find the smallest input
              file that provokes the problem.

            <b>Q</b>: How does CMUCL compare with other Common Lisp
            implementations?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: The short answer is that this really depends on your
              needs. Most free implementations are fairly easy to install, and
              you should be able to obtain evaluation copies of the commercial
              implementations, so it isn't difficult to make a choice yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              A longer answer is that compared with the various commercial
              Common Lisp implementations (see <a href=
              "https://www.lisp.org/">lisp.org</a> for a list), CMUCL is free:
              you can use it for zero upfront cost, and it has a very liberal
              license that imposes few restrictions on its use and
              redistribution. You also have access to the source code if you
              wish to customize the implementation to your requirements.
              However, you can't get a support contract from the vendor (though
              you could probably find experienced CMUCL developers prepared to
              freelance -- contact the cmucl-imp mailing list), and CMUCL is
              missing certain features present in the commercial
              implementations (portability to Microsoft Windows platforms,
              graphical browsers, GUI widgets, add-on libraries ...).
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared with <a href="https://clisp.cons.org/">CLISP</a>, CMUCL
              runs on fewer platforms and has significantly higher memory
              usage. CLISP has better internationalization support, in
              particular support for UNICODE. Since CMUCL compiles to native
              code, it is an order of magnitude faster on most applications
              than CLISP's bytecode execution model, and generally provides
              more useful debugging output. However, the mathematical
              primitives in CLISP are very fast, in particular its bignum
              operations. CLISP also provides floats of unlimited precision,
              while CMUCL is limited to IEEE-754 single-float and double-float,
              and an extended double-double-float. CMUCL has a more powerful
              foreign function interface than CLISP, and supports
              multiprocessing on x86 platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared with <a href="https://sbcl.sf.net/">SBCL</a> (a fork
              from the CMUCL implementation), CMUCL a different set of features
              (it includes a Motif interface, but does not have SBCL's native
              threads on Linux/x86 platforms, nor Unicode support). CMUCL has a
              faster compiler, but compiled code runs at a similar speed to
              SBCL-generated code. SBCL is closer to the ANSI CL specification
              in some respects, and generally emits more warnings about
              ANSI-compliance. SBCL runs on a larger number of platforms than
              CMUCL, and in general is more actively developed than CMUCL.

            <b>Q</b>: What user interface do you use with CMUCL?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: Many people like to use <a href=

          <li>
            <b>Q</b>: How difficult is it to port CMUCL to a new platform?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: Short answer: fairly difficult. There are two aspects
              to porting: writing a backend for the new the CPU architecture,
              and handling the runtime's interaction with the operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Writing a compiler backend to target a new CPU involves deciding
              on a register allocation policy, and writing assembly definitions
              for the CMUCL virtual machine operations (VOPs). There are also a
              number of utility routines to write in assembly, and some
              CPU-specific constants (number of registers, how FPU exceptions
              are reported to user land, how wide floating point registers are)
              to define.
            </p>
            <p>
              Targeting a new operating system involves getting the runtime to
              compile. This means stuff like deciding on a memory map,
              implementing memory management routines. The trickiest bit is
              probably signal handling, and extracting the address of the
              faulting instruction from a <code>ucontext_t</code>.

            <b>Q</b>: The garbage collector doesn't want to collect my big
            object!
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: You may have done something like
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
   USER&gt; (setq *print-array* nil)
   USER&gt; (defvar *big* (make-array 42000000 :element-type 'double-float))
   ;; use big, then get rid of it
   USER&gt; (setq *big* nil)
   USER&gt; (gc :full t)    ;; :full only with generational collector
</pre>
            <p>
              You no longer have any references to the array, so were expecting
              it to be garbage collected. However, according to
              <code>(ROOM)</code> it wasn't. The reason is that the <a href=
              "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/25_aa.htm">
              read-eval-print-loop</a> maintains variables called
              <code>*</code>, <code>**</code> and <code>***</code>, that
              reference the values of the last three forms evaluated, and the
              array is still accessible from these. Try evaluating a few other
              forms (like <code>1</code>), then call the garbage collector
              again.
            </p>
            <p>
              (This question isn't specific to CMUCL; you'll observe the same
              in other implementations.)

            <p>
              <b>A</b>: This is the generational conservative garbage collector
              telling you that you have exhausted the available dynamic space
              (the memory zone that is used for normal lisp objects). You can
              increase the size of the dynamic space reserved on startup by
              using the <code>-dynamic-space-size</code> commandline option
              (see the <a href="../docs/cmu-user/html/index.html"><i>CMUCL
              User's Manual</i></a> for details). You can determine the amount
              of dynamic space currently available as follows:

            <b>Q</b>: What does <code>Error in function UNIX::SIGSEGV-HANDLER:
            Segmentation Violation at #x1004C7BD.</code> mean?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: This means that CMUCL has received a signal indicating
              a segmentation violation from the operating system, at an
              unexpected address (it already uses SIGSEGV for normal operation
              of the garbage collector). This can be due to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>you have linked with some alien code (such as a shared
              library) which is generating segmentation violations. This can be
              due to a bug in the alien code, or to you passing it invalid
              pointers.
              </li>
              <li>you have lied to the compiler (written incorrect type
              declarations), and compiled your code in unsafe mode (with the
              speed optimization quality higher than the safety quality). For
              example, you may have declared that a variable was an array, and
              actually passed a list to the function. Make sure that you
              compile and run your code in safe mode before trying to increase
              its speed.
              </li>
              <li>you may have encountered an internal bug in CMUCL. It's quite

              <b>A</b>: You may encounter this problem when porting code
              written for CMUCL to another Common Lisp implementation -- such
              as LispWorks or OpenMCL -- which is more conservative than CMUCL
              in propagating declarations to the evaluation environment. For
              instance, consider the compilation of a file containing the
              following code:
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
   (defconstant +foo+ #\a)
   (defun foo () #.(char-code +foo+))
</pre>
            <p>
              This code will compile in CMUCL, but some other implementations
              will complain that the symbol <code>+foo+</code> is not bound
              when compiling the function <code>foo</code>. CMUCL propagates
              the compile-time effect of the DEFCONSTANT form to what CLtS
              calls the <i>evaluation environment</i>, so that it becomes
              available when compiling the remainder of the file. Certain other
              implementations are stricter in not leaking information in this
              way, and require you to write the above code as
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
   (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel)
     (defconstant +foo+ #\a))
   (defun foo () #.(char-code +foo+))
</pre>
            <p>
              This code will also work in CMUCL. See Section 3.2.3.1
              <i>Processing of Top Level Forms</i> of CLtS for more details
              (the specification is somewhat vague about some of these issues,
              which explains why there is considerable variation in behaviour
              from one implementation to another).

            <b>Q</b>: What is the meaning of the error message I see when
            tracing functions: <code>:FUNCTION-END breakpoints are currently
            unsupported for the known return convention</code> ?
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: This is a deficiency in the tracing support that has
              been fixed. It shouldn't happen anymore, but if you do see this,
              please report this bug. A simple workaround is to use
            </p>
            <pre class="code">
   USERL&gt; (trace my-function :encapsulate t)
</pre>
            <p>
              This causes a different mechanism to be used for the breakpoints
              that are used by tracing facility.

            <b>Q</b>: On my Linux machine, CMUCL dies on startup saying
            <pre>
Error in allocating memory, please do "echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory"
or get more memory+swap.
</pre>
            <p>
              <b>A</b>: Hopefully the message is fairly clear. The problem is
              that due to implementation choices, CMUCL reserves a large
              address space when it starts up, instead of allocating memory on
              demand, as do most applications. In its default configuration,
              the linux kernel may refuse to reserve amounts of memory which
              are far greater than the amout of available RAM and swap (this is
              called overcommitting, since the kernel commits itself to satisfy
              more memory than is actually available). You can either increase
              the amount of swap available (see the <code>mkswap</code>
              command), or change the kernel's policy using (as root) the
              command quoted above.
