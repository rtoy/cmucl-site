@@HEADING(mailing list & help for CMUCL users)

<p> CMUCL is supported by a number of <strong>mailing lists</strong> at
    cons.org, running under Listar. To obtain help on the use of the
    list management software, send an email with an empty subject and a
    body of <tt>help</tt> (and nothing else) to
    @@EMAIL(listar@cons.org). <strong>Please don't send subscribe
    requests to the list addresses</strong>, since they won't be
    seen by the mailing list software and will only annoy the subscribers.
    Always use the appropriate <tt>-request</tt> address. </p>


<dl>
<dt>@@EMAIL(cmucl-announce at cons.org)</dt>
<dd>

<p> is a low-volume mailing list, reserved for announcements such as new
    releases, new ports, important patches or other resources closely
    related to CMUCL. No discussion should happen on this list. This
    mailing list will be moderated when necessary. </p>

<p> Send email to @@EMAIL(cmucl-announce-request@cons.org) to be
    added or removed from the list (using a subject of <tt>subscribe</tt>
    or <tt>unsubscribe</tt> and an empty body) and to
    @@EMAIL(cmucl-announce-human-request@cons.org) in case the former
    doesn't work. </p>
</dd>

<dt>@@EMAIL(cmucl-imp at cons.org)</dt>
<dd>
<p> is a mailing list for technical discussion of implementation-specific
    issues, like ports to new platforms, bug fixes, new features,
    design of APIs or ports of major third-party packages to CMUCL. </p>

<p> Send email to @@EMAIL(cmucl-imp-request@cons.org) to be added or
    removed from the list (using a subject of <tt>subscribe</tt> or

<dt>@@EMAIL(cmucl-help at cons.org)</dt>
<dd>
<p> is a mailing list to ask for help in setting up and using CMUCL.
    Posters should read the CMUCL User's Manual <!-- and the archive of
    these mailing lists --> prior to using this list. Otherwise it is open
    to every question related to CMUCL. For bug reports, please try out the
    latest release to see whether your problem has been fixed, and please
    read this guide on <a href =
    "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report
    Bugs Effectively</a>, if you haven't already done so. </p>

<p> Help requests related to rebuilding CMUCL and applying patches may be
    sent to <i>cmucl-imp</i> also. Problems related to compiler
    optimization are probably better reported to <i>cmucl-imp</i>, but
    please make sure your post is about a specific situation with a proper
    description. </p>

<p> Experienced CMUCL users are encouraged to join this list and help new
    users. </p>

<p> Send mail to @@EMAIL(cmucl-help-request@cons.org) to be added or
    removed from the list (using a subject of <tt>subscribe</tt> or
    <tt>unsubscribe</tt> and an empty body) and to
    @@EMAIL(cmucl-help-human-request@cons.org) in case the former doesn't
    work. </p>
</dd>

<dt>@@EMAIL(cmucl-commit at cons.org)</dt>
<dd>
<p> is a mailing list that receives notifications of commits to the CMUCL
    CVS tree. This is intended primarily for developers, but may be of
    interest to users who wish to follow development.  </p>
</dl>


<p> The <i>cmucl-help</i> and <i>cmucl-imp</i> mailing lists are available
    over NNTP, or through a web-based browsing system, through the <a href
    = "http://gmane.org/">Gmane mail-to-news gateway</a>, respectively as
    the groups <a href = "http://news.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.cmucl.general/">
    gmane.lisp.cmucl.general</a> and <a href =
    "http://news.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.cmucl.devel/" >
    gmane.lisp.cmucl.devel</a>. Gmane also allows you to search the
    post-2002 archives of these two lists. </p>

<p> To avoid spam reaching the lists, please do not post their addresses
    to USENET or public web pages. You can post a link to this URL instead, or
    reference the <tt>-request</tt> addresses instead. </p>

<p> If you want to send <strong>MIME attachments</strong> with your
    message, make sure you use one of the <tt>text/*</tt> Content-Types
    (for example <tt>text/plain</tt>), otherwise the mailing list software
    will strip out the attachment. </p>


<!--
<h2>Mailing list archives</h2>

<p> Archives of mailing lists running on cons.org are available as <a
    href = "http://www2.cons.org:8000/maillists/">
    http://www2.cons.org:8000/maillists/&lt;list-name&gt;</a>. There
    is currently no searchable archive. </p>
-->


<h2>Commercial support</h2>

<p> There is no formal commercial support structure for CMUCL. However,
    some of the CMUCL developers may be available on an individual basis
    for consulting, for example to implement new features or help in
    porting a particular application. Please email the cmucl-imp list with
    details of your requirements. </p>


<h2>Newsgroups</h2>

<p> The USENET newsgroup <a href="news:comp.lang.lisp">comp.lang.lisp</a>
    is related to Common Lisp. You may wish to read its <a href =
    "http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~csr21/lispfaq.html">current FAQ</a>, or its <a href =
    "http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/lang/lisp/top.html">
    older FAQ</a>. </p>


<h2>Bug Tracking</h2>

<p> <a href = "http://entomotomy.cliki.net/index">Entomotomy</a> is a
    shared bug tracking database for projects based on the CMUCL source
    code (currently CMUCL and SBCL). It is not an end-user bug reporting
    system, and is mostly of interest to CMUCL developers. </p>
