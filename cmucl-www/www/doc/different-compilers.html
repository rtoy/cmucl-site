          <strong>Documentation</strong>: Compilers and interpreters in CMUCL
        </div>
        <p>
          You can execute Common Lisp code in CMUCL in several different ways:
          using the interpreter, the byte-code compiler, or the native-code
          compiler. This document provides more information on the differences
          between these parts of CMUCL.
        </p>
        <p>
          CMUCL has the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A trivial "baby" interpreter, that handles things like function
          application and SETQ, and which is present in all CMUCL cores, even
          those without a compiler present.
          </li>
          <li>A complete, "grownup" interpreter, which can handle the full
          language. It works by using the first stages of the compiler, to
          convert the source code to the IR1 internal representation (which is
          a flow-graph based representation, with implicit control-flow
          information; also called ICR: Implicit Continuation Representation),
          which is then interpreted. This interpreter depends on the compiler
          being present (and thus can't be used when CMUCL is rebuilding
          itself; this is why there's also a baby interpreter). Since it
          converts before interpreting, it behaves like a compiler when it
          comes to things like macro-expansion, or handling of circular source
          forms.
            <p>
              The interpreter is invoked when you enter forms into the listener
              (i.e. the interactive read-eval-print loop), or when you
              <code class="function-name">LOAD</code> code from a file without
              first compiling it using <code class=
              "function-name">COMPILE-FILE</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>A byte-code compiler. This also works off the IR1 internal
          representation, but instead of interpreting that directly, it
          transforms it to byte-codes for a stack-based VM, which can be
          written to a processor-independent byte-fasl file. The byte-code is
          finally interpreted by a byte-code interpreter.
            <p>
              The main advantage of the byte-code compiler are space-savings,
              since the byte-coded representation is fairly compact (the
              cmu-user manual gives a factor of 6), yet still faster (by an
              order of magnitude, says the manual) than interpretation. It also
              gives you processor-independence, though not
              endianness-independence.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can byte-compile whole files, or you can tell the file
              compiler to only byte-compile certain parts, like e.g. top-level
              forms, which aren't usually time-critical (this is the default).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>The native compiler. This also runs through IR1, which is --
          after extensive optimizations -- transformed into IR2, the virtual
          machine representation (VMR). The virtual machine that the VMR is
          based-on is defined by the processor-specific backends of the
          compiler, so that it can be tailored to the target processor as
          needed, yet still allows things like register allocation algorithms,
          etc. to be shared between backends. Finally the VMR is converted to
          assembly code, through the VOP's code-generators. The assembly code
          is slightly optimized, then assembled to machine code, and finally
          emitted to the FASL file.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
          Controlling the choice of compiler
        </h2>
        <p>
          The baby interpreter is only used when evaluating simple forms at the
          listener: simple function calls, <code class=
          "function-name">SETQ</code>, PROGN and so forth. Anything more
          complicated at the listener is evaluated by the grownup interpreter.
          Compilation is provoked by the function <code class=
          "function-name">COMPILE</code>, or by compiling from a file with
          <code class="function-name">COMPILE-FILE</code>. The choice between
          native and byte-code compilation depends on a number of factors, as
          documented in the <a href="../docs/cmu-user/html/index.html"><i>CMUCL
          Users' Manual</i></a>.
