<dd> The <strong>November snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded, for
sparcv9/Solaris, x86/FreeBSD and x86/Linux.

<dt>2003-10-28</dt>
<dd> <a href = "http://common-lisp.net/project/lgtk/">lGTk</a> is a set of
bindings to the GTk GUI toolkit. It contains bindings to a subset of the
GTk version 2.0 widgets, and requires a recent CMUCL with callback support
(try one of the recent snapshots). 

<dt>2003-10-24</dt>
<dd> Support for <strong>graceful heap overflow</strong> has been committed
by Raymond Toy. This means that when the heap is exhausted, instead of getting
the dreaded <tt>*A2 gc_alloc_new_region failed</tt> abort, you will be put
in the debugger. Currently implemented for SPARC and x86 platforms, and
announced by a <tt>:heap-overflow-check</tt> feature. 

<dt>2003-10-03</dt>
<dd> The <strong>October snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded, for
sparcv9/Solaris, x86/FreeBSD and x86/Linux. There are two builds for
sparcv9, one with the new generational garbage collector (please test and
report any problems!), and the other with the traditional two-space
collector.

<dt>2003-09-08</dt>
<dd> An experimental <strong>statistical profiler</strong> has been posted
to the cmucl-imp mailing list by Gerd Moellmann. The principle is to take
periodic samples of the currently executing function and call stack, to
record where CMUCL is spending the most time. The profiling is driven by
the <tt>SIGPROF</tt> signal. The profiler is able to generate a time usage
histogram, and to produce a call graph with breakdown into cycles. 

<dt>2003-09-05</dt>
<dd> Some preliminary work on <strong>instruction scheduling</strong> for
the SPARC platform has been carried out by Raymond Toy. The aim is for
CMUCL to emit code that is cleverer about instruction latencies and
dependencies: for example, trying to insert a few instructions between a
load and the use of the loaded register (to avoid the pipeline being
stalled). This slows down compilation, but has the potential to improve the
performance of generated code. More work is needed on ways to rearrange and
group instructions. 

<dt>2003-09-03</dt>
<dd> Support for <strong>dynamic-extent on SPARC</strong> has been
committed, thanks to Raymond Toy. 

<dt>2003-09-02</dt>
<dd> The <strong>September snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded, for
sparcv9/Solaris, x86/FreeBSD and x86/Linux. There are two builds for
sparcv9, one with the new generational garbage collector (please test and
report any problems!), and the other with the traditional two-space
collector.

<dt>2003-08-22</dt>
<dd> The generational garbage collector (:gencgc feature) has been ported
to SPARC, thanks to Raymond Toy. This feature will remain experimental
until further testing has been undertaken. Unlike the x86 version of
gencgc, which is a conservative collector, the SPARC gencgc is a precise
collector.

<dt>2003-08-21</dt>
<dd> Preliminary support for <strong>delivery as a standalone
executable</strong> on ELF platforms (currently only FreeBSD) has been
developed by Fred Gilham. This involves linking the CMUCL runtime and the
different spaces in a core file together in a single executable, that can
then be run without runtime dependencies on anything other than standard
platform libraries. 

<dt>2003-08-08</dt>
<dd> Snapshots of the CMUCL User's Manual have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots</tt> directory of the download sites. PDF, A4 Postscript and
dvi formats are available. These snapshots are intended to help users who
are experimenting with the binaries that are regularly built from CVS. 

<dt>2003-08-06</dt>
<dd> Support for the <strong>dynamic-extent declaration</strong> on x86 has
been contributed by Gerd Moellmann. This means that <tt>&amp;rest</tt>
argument lists can be allocated on the stack (instead of on the heap), and
be freed automatically when the function exits. 

<dt>2003-07-06</dt>
<dd> Support for the <strong>dynamic-extent declaration</strong> on x86 has
been contributed by Gerd Moellmann. This means that <tt>&amp;rest</tt>
argument lists can be allocated on the stack (instead of on the heap), and
be freed automatically when the function exits. 

<dt>2003-06-06</dt>
<dd> An implementation of <strong>simple streams</strong>, based on work by
Paul Foley, has been committed.

<dt>2003-05-29</dt>
<dd> An experimental CMUCL binding to the Qt graphical libraries, called <a
href = "http://mypage.bluewin.ch/bandersnatch">Idolino</a>, has been
announced by Heiner Schwarte.

<dt>2003-05-25</dt>
<dd> An experimental way of delivering programs as <strong>standalone
executables</strong> has been posted to the cmucl-imp mailing list. The
idea consists of stuffing the lisp image into an ELF section of the
runtime, and extracting it on startup. This makes it possible to use CMUCL
to produce an executable program that has no runtime dependencies other than
the platform's standard shared libraries. 

<dt>2003-05-23</dt>
<dd> An implementation of <strong>fwrappers</strong> has been committed,
and the profiling and trace facilities have been modified to use it. This
provides a more uniform way of implementing mechanisms that use function
encapsulation. 

<dt>2003-05-13</dt>
<dd> CMUCL now supports <strong>package locks</strong>, with an API very
similar to the same feature in Allegro CL. Attempts to change the structure
of a locked package (for example by changing its export or use list) lead
to a continuable PACKAGE-LOCKED-ERROR being signaled. Symbols in a package
whose definition-lock is enabled are protected from redefinition. The
<tt>EXT:WITHOUT-PACKAGE-LOCKS</tt> macro can be used to execute forms with
all package locks disabled.

<dt>2003-04-29</dt>
<dd> ANSI compliance fixes: in safe code, the CMUCL compiler no longer
deletes dead code that could lead to errors being signaled at runtime.

<dt>2003-04-26</dt>
<dd> Binaires from CVS HEAD for x86-linux, x86-FreeBSD, sparcv9-solaris and
alpha-linux have been uploaded to the download sites.

<dt>2003-04-20</dt>
<dd> Many bugs in CMUCL's type system (detected by Paul Dietz's ansi-test
suite, distributed with GCL) have been fixed. 

<dt>2003-04-15</dt>
<dd> <strong>Control stack overflow checking</strong> has been implemented
for x86-FreeBSD and x86-Linux, thanks to Gerd Moellmann. Previously, code
that overflowed the control stack (for example due to unchecked recursion)
would cause CMUCL to crash with a segmentation violation; it will now lead
to a continuable STORAGE-ERROR being signaled.

<dt>2003-04-10</dt>
<dd> CMUCL 18e has been released. See the <a href =
"release-18e.txt">release notes</a> for details of all the improvements
since 18d. 

<dt>2003-04-03</dt>
<dd> Binaries for the 18e release for different platforms will start
appearing on the download site and mirrors. The release will be announced
officially once binaries are available for most platforms. 

<dt>2003-03-22</dt>
<dd> The CVS repository has been tagged for the 18e release. Binaries for
different platforms will be made available in the binaries directory of the
download mirrors; please test them on your applications and report any
problems. The release should occur in early April.

<dt>2003-03-10</dt>
<dd> The anoncvs repository is available again, following an OS upgrade on
the main CMUCL server.

<dt>2003-03-01</dt>
<dd> CMUCL on MIPS running IRIX: Mike McDonald has revived the MIPS
support, which should be included in the next release.

<dt>2003-02-22</dt>
<dd> A new GerdsPCL tarball is available in the experimental/pcl directory
of the download sites. Binaries for x86-FreeBSD and x86-Linux are also
provided. This release adds support for profiling methods.

<dt>2003-02-20</dt>
<dd> Experimental support for hardware cycle counters has been added for
x86 and UltraSPARC platforms. This is based on the RDTSC instruction on
Pentium and better processors, and on reading the <tt>%TICK</tt> register
on UltraSPARC.

<dt>2003-02-17</dt>
<dd> A new GerdsPCL tarball is available in the experimental directory of
the download sites. This adds improved tracing support and a <tt
class="function-name">PRINT-OBJECT</tt> method for conditions.

<dt>2003-02-06</dt>
<dd> A cross-referencing facility has been added to the compiler, thanks to
Eric Marsden. This provides functions <tt class = "function-name"
>WHO-CALLS</tt>, <tt class = "function-name" >WHO-REFERENCES</tt>, <tt
class = "function-name" >WHO-BINDS</tt> and <tt class = "function-name"
>WHO-SETS</tt> for functions and global variables. Documentation is
provided in the CMUCL User's Manual.

<dt>2003-02-05</dt>
<dd> Support for generalized function names has been added, thanks to Gerd
Moellmann. Standard function names are restricted to symbol like <tt>FOO</tt>,
and the special case of <tt>(SETF FOO)</tt>. This patch allows general
names of the form <tt>(FOO BAR BAZ)</tt>, which should be particularly
useful for naming CLOS-related functions. 

<dt>2003-02-03</dt>
<dd> Documentation: a new document with information on <a href =
"../doc/cmucl-history.html">boostrapping early versions of CMUCL</a> has
been added to the website.

<dt>2003-01-26</dt>
<dd> Binaries for x86-linux, x86-freebsd and sparcv9-solaris from
2003-01-23 source have been uploaded to the binaries directory of the
download sites.

<dt>2003-01-22</dt>
<dd> Anoncvs access has been temporarily disabled, pending a fix to the
security problem in cvsd. Apologies for the inconvenience.

<dt>2003-01-13</dt>
<dd> Documentation: a new document provinding <a href =
"../doc/gc-tuning.html">hints on tuning the CMUCL garbage collector</a> has
been added to the website. 

<dt>2003-01-10</dt>
<dd> Antonio Leitao has posted the code of an Emacs-based debugger and
inspector for CMUCL, that is based on ILISP. See the cmucl-imp mailing list
for the source code.
