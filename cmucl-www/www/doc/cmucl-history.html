          <strong>Documentation</strong>: History of the CMUCL Project
        </div>
        <p>
          This page is derived from an email message from Rob MacLachlan, in
          response to a question as to the recursive nature of CMUCL
          bootstrapping. Given that CMUCL requires CMUCL to build itself; how
          were the first iterations of CMUCL developed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lisp implementation work at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie
          Mellon University</a> started with <i>Spice Lisp</i> as a part of the
          Spice project (circa 1980). [SPICE stood for <i>Scientific Personal
          Integrated Computing Environment</i>.] ARPA's funding of Spice Lisp
          was one of the reasons that ARPA felt it had an interest in some
          common lisp dialect. This standardization effort came to be called
          (rather unimaginitively) <i>Common Lisp</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Spice Lisp was committed to being Common Lisp before anyone knew
          what that would be. We started calling it CMU Common Lisp when the
          Spice project ended (around 1985). The code base has gown
          tremendously and mutated greatly, but some parts, such as the core of
          <code class="function-name">RANDOM</code> do go back to the very
          beginning.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Target machines
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first machine that CMUCL was developed on was the PDP10; this was
          where the compiler and genesis ran. We also had an instruction-level
          simulator for the target machine which ran on the PDP10. This was
          used to debug many core parts of the original runtime.
        </p>
        <p class="technical">
          The PDP-10 computer and its predecessor the PDP-6 computer were, by
          design, especially well-suited to Lisp because they had 36-bit words
          and 18-bit addresses. This architecture allowed a cons cell to be
          stored in one word; single instructions could extract the car and cdr
          parts. The PDP-6 and PDP-10 had fast, powerful stack instructions
          that enabled fast function calling. [from lisp.org]
        </p>
        <p>
          The first target machine was the <a href=
          "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~pmaydell/PERQ/">Perq</a>, which
          was a microcoded graphics workstation inspired by the Xerox Alto and
          D-machines. We wrote our own Lisp instruction set in microcode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting in about 1984, we hacked over the the compiler to emit code
          for the IBM RT PC RISC architecture. This was sort of a post-pass
          that translated the high-level operations (formerly bytecodes) into
          assembler. There was about 6000 lines of hand-coded assembly support
          for the runtime, including bignum arithmetic, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was in 1985 that I [Rob MacLachlan] started work on Python. This
          was a total compiler rewrite aimed toward efficient support for
          multiple "conventional" architectures. People have run the CMUCL
          compiler code in other Common Lisp implementations, but we never did.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Python backend was for the IBM RT PC. This was sort of
          halfway to the system we know now, since it still used the handcoded
          assembly runtime. The next backend was for the MIPS in the form of
          the DEC PMAX workstation. This shook out a lot of problems in the
          porting model, and was also when we moved everything possible into
          Lisp (such as bignums). This happened in about 1991.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next came the SPARC, but initially only under Mach. The first
          supported operating system that CMUCL ran on was SunOS. After this
          port was done by volunteer effort, people outside CMU started to use
          CMUCL. This was around 1992.
        </p>
        <p>
          This first compiler ran in MacLISP. It was called "xc" for
          cross-compiler. It did not support full Common Lisp (macros had to be
          written in MacLISP, and there was no support for lexical closures.)
          This code evolved into "clc" (Common Lisp Compiler) which
          self-compiled in Common Lisp.
        </p>
        <p>
          An interesting example of the process of Lisp specification:
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial implementation of Common Lisp DEFSTRUCT had to be written
          in MacLisp, since "xc" ran in MacLisp. This code was initially used
          under Spice Lisp with minor modifications, but eventually we decided
          to rewrite it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This version was written in idiomatic Common Lisp, therefore it used
          DEFSTRUCT structures to describe the format of DEFSTRUCT structures.
          This was initially compiled and debugged using the previous DEFSTRUCT
          implementation, but once it worked, we threw the old code away.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Capabilities of early CMUCL
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Perq had 1 or 2 meg of memory, and the Lisp image was was about
          1.5 meg. Code density was high. The loop of NTHCDR was less than 8
          bytes. Hemlock was written on this platform, and was widely used by
          non-lisp programmers because it was the only sophisticated editor
          that ran on the Perq. Speed was not great. TAK ran initially in 30
          seconds, and that was one of our better benchmarks. Floating point
          performance was measured in Kflops. There was virtual memory
          (translation done in microcode), and we frequently thrashed. The OS
          was research, and we frequently crashed.

          I believe that Scott Fahlman published a paper somewhere about the
          bootstrapping path of Spice Lisp. See also:
