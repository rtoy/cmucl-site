            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>READ-CYCLE-COUNTER</code> no longer destroys any live
                values in the <code>EDX</code> or <code>ECX</code> registers.
              </li>
              <li>Add <code>VM::WITH-CYCLE-COUNTER</code> to return the number
              of ticks elapsed when executing the body. The number of ticks is
              the number of CPU cycles, except for ppc/darwin.

            <ul>
              <li>Implement faster <code>LOGCOUNT</code> function on x86, if
              <code>:SSE3</code> feature is available. (Only applies to new
              uses of <code>LOGCOUNT</code>. The core uses the default
              version.)
              </li>
              <li>On x86, <code>SET-FLOATING-POINT-MODES</code> clears any
              current and accrued exceptions that match exceptions in
              <code>:TRAPS</code>. Previously, enabling a trap when the current
              exception also listed that trap caused the exception to be
              immediately signaled. This no longer happens and now matches how
              ppc and sparc behave.

            The 2012-05 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
            details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>ASDF2 updated to version 2.21.
              </li>
              <li>Many additional aliases for external formats added that match
              the glibc iconv aliases.
              </li>
              <li>External format for UTF-32 was generating an error when
              converting octets to a string.
              </li>
              <li>The UTF-16-BE and UTF-16-LE external formats were returning
              the incorrect number of octets when surrogates pairs were
              decoded. This confuses the stream buffering code.
              </li>
              <li>Fix typo in ISO8859-2 external format that caused it not to
              work correctly. This type potentially also caused failures for
              all other external formats that were based on ISO8859-2.
              </li>
              <li>Fix <a href=
              "http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/ticket/58">ticket:58</a>:
              UTF-16 buffering problem.

            The 2012-04 snapshot has been released. See the <a href=
            "../downloads/snapshots/2012/04/release-20d.txt">release notes</a>
            for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the 20c release..
            <ul>
              <li>Added a new contrib, <code>contrib-packed-sse2</code> to
              allow packed operations ala SSE2. Support for some packed sse2
              operations like multiply, divide, and shuffle for both packed
              singles and doubles. All operations are done on top of
              <code>(complex double-float)</code> numbers. Functions are
              provided to put and get packed singles/doubles from
              <code>(complex double-float)</code>.
              </li>
              <li>Some VOP costs were incorrect which prevented the fast
              complex double-float multiplier from being used when sse3 is
              available.
              </li>
              <li>Add micro-optimization for x86 (already available on sparc
              and ppc) where <code>(logand &lt;signed-byte 32&gt;
              #xffffffff)</code> generates a register move instead of and'ing
              with #xffffffff.
              </li>
              <li>Updated to Unicode 6.1.0.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>LISP:UNICODE-COMPLETE</code> no longer signals an error
                if the prefix isn't a prefix of the name of any Unicode
                character.
              </li>
              <li>Add <code>-R</code> option to build.sh to force recompiling
              the C runtime.
              </li>
              <li>UTF-8 is now build into the core and always available.
              </li>
              <li>A bug in <code>UNICODE-COMPLETE-NAME</code> has been fixed.
              (Mostly useful with Slime when completing character names.)
              </li>
              <li>An issue with blocked signals after an interrupt has been
              fixed.
              </li>
              <li>The ppc port has been revived; only a Unicode version is
              currently available.
              </li>
              <li>CMUCL was not printing pathnames like <code>(make-pathname
              :directory '(:absolute "tmp" "" "/"))</code> correctly. This is
              now printed using <code>#P(...)</code>.
              </li>
              <li>The directory structure has been changed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>ASDF2</code> updated to version 2.019.
              </li>
              <li>Behavior of <code>STRING-TO-OCTETS</code> has changed. This
              is an incompatible change from the previous version but should be
              more useful when a buffer is given which is not large enough to
              hold all the octets for the given string. See docstring for more
              details.
              </li>
              <li>DECODE-FLOAT was not correctly declared and could not be
              compiled to handle double-double-floats.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

              <li>Improve type propagation for <code>LOAD-TIME-VALUE</code>.
              </li>
              <li>Getting documentation of a structure via
              <code>DOCUMENTATION</code> no longer signals an error.
              </li>
              <li>Reduce unnecessary consing of <code>SAP</code>s in
              <code>ROOM</code>.
              </li>
              <li>Make stack overflow checking actually work on Mac OS X. The
              implementation had the <code>:stack-checking</code> feature, but
              it didn't actually prevent stack overflows from crashing lisp.
              </li>
              <li>Fix rounding of numbers larger than a fixnum.

            The 2011-07 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
            details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>Unicode database updated to Unicode 6.0.0.
              </li>
              <li>ASDF2 updated to version 2.016.1
              </li>
              <li>Add <code>LISP:LOAD-ALL-UNICODE-DATA</code> to load all the
              unicode information into core. This is useful for creating an
              executable image that does not need unidata.bin.
              </li>
              <li>CMUCL no longer exits if you specify a core file with an
              executable image. A warning is printed instead and the core file
              is used.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/ticket/43">Trac
                #43</a> has been fixed in a better way. The previous fix was

            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>:CMUCL</code> is now in <code>*FEATURES*</code>
              </li>
              <li>Added command line option, <code>-unidata</code>, to allow
              user to specify the location and name of the unidata.bin file.
              This is used instead of the default location.
              </li>
              <li>Opening a file with <code>:IF-EXISTS :NEW-VERSION</code> no

            The 2011-04 snapshot has been released. See the release nots for
            details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>In <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>, the second return value is now
              non-nil if there are style warnings. Previously, style warnings
              were erroneously ignored.
              </li>
              <li>ASDF has been updated to version 2.014.1
              </li>

            Snapshot 2011-03
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 2011-03 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
            details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>In <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>, the <code>:OUTPUT-FILE</code>
              can also be a stream. CMUCL was erroneously signaling an error..
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>(OPEN f :DIRECTION :IO :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL)</code> no
                longer signals an error if the file <code>f</code> does not
                exist. It returns <code>NIL</code> now.
              </li>
              <li>In some situations the compiler could not constant fold
              <code>SQRT</code> calls because <code>KERNEL:%SQRT</code> was not
              defined on x86 with SSE2. This is fixed now.
              </li>
              <li>In an earlier snapshot to add support for character name
              completion with slime, a bug was introduced where cmucl could no
              longer read <code>#\latin_small_letter_a</code>. This is fixed in
              this version.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Snapshot 2011-02
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 2011-02 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
            details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>EXT::DESCRIBE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</code> was not exported.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>TRACE</code> was erroneously allowing encapsulation when
                tracing local flet/labels functions. This doesn't actually
                trace anything. An error is now signaled in this case. If you
                are sure, you can specify <code>:ENCAPSULATE NIL</code> to
                disable encapsulation.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Snapshot 2011-01
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The 2011-01 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
            details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
            this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
            <ul>
              <li>Initial support for Solaris/x86. CMUCL will run on
              Solaris/x86 with all features available.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>UNINTERN</code> no longer removes the wrong symbol.
                <code>UNINTERN</code> would remove the symbol when inherited
                from another package although it should not.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>DEFSTRUCT</code> allows multiple keyword constructors as
                required by the spec..
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>SUBSEQ</code> with an end index less than the start index
                sometimes crashes CMUCL. Now, signal an error if the boudns are
                not valid.
              </li>
              <li>Localization support was causing many calls to stat trying to
              find non-existent translation files. This has been fixed so that
              the results are cached. (If new translations are added, the cache
              will need to be cleared or cmucl restarted.) This change cuts
              building time by half on Solaris/sparc.
              </li>
              <li>On NetBSD, function-end breakpoints, especially for
              tail-recursive functions, are working now.
              </li>
              <li>On NetBSD, display of FP numbers (sse2 and x87) during
              tracing has been corrected. Previously, random values were
              displayed.
              </li>
              <li>Executables images can now be created on NetBSD again.
              </li>
            </ul>
