            <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/lgtk/">lGTk</a> is a set of
            bindings to the GTk GUI toolkit. It contains bindings to a subset
            of the GTk version 2.0 widgets, and requires a recent CMUCL with
            callback support (try one of the recent snapshots).

            Support for <strong>graceful heap overflow</strong> has been
            committed by Raymond Toy. This means that when the heap is
            exhausted, instead of getting the dreaded <code>*A2
            gc_alloc_new_region failed</code> abort, you will be put in the
            debugger. Currently implemented for SPARC and x86 platforms, and
            announced by a <code>:heap-overflow-check</code> feature.

            The <strong>October snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded,

            builds for sparcv9, one with the new generational garbage collector

            traditional two-space collector.

            An experimental <strong>statistical profiler</strong> has been
            posted to the cmucl-imp mailing list by Gerd Moellmann. The
            principle is to take periodic samples of the currently executing
            function and call stack, to record where CMUCL is spending the most
            time. The profiling is driven by the <code>SIGPROF</code> signal.
            The profiler is able to generate a time usage histogram, and to
            produce a call graph with breakdown into cycles.

            Some preliminary work on <strong>instruction scheduling</strong>
            for the SPARC platform has been carried out by Raymond Toy. The aim
            is for CMUCL to emit code that is cleverer about instruction
            latencies and dependencies: for example, trying to insert a few
            instructions between a load and the use of the loaded register (to
            avoid the pipeline being stalled). This slows down compilation, but
            has the potential to improve the performance of generated code.
            More work is needed on ways to rearrange and group instructions.

            The generational garbage collector (:gencgc feature) has been
            ported to SPARC, thanks to Raymond Toy. This feature will remain
            experimental until further testing has been undertaken. Unlike the
            x86 version of gencgc, which is a conservative collector, the SPARC
            gencgc is a precise collector.

            Preliminary support for <strong>delivery as a standalone
            executable</strong> on ELF platforms (currently only FreeBSD) has
            been developed by Fred Gilham. This involves linking the CMUCL
            runtime and the different spaces in a core file together in a
            single executable, that can then be run without runtime
            dependencies on anything other than standard platform libraries.

            Snapshots of the CMUCL User's Manual have been uploaded to the

            Postscript and dvi formats are available. These snapshots are
            intended to help users who are experimenting with the binaries that
            are regularly built from CVS.

            Support for the <strong>dynamic-extent declaration</strong> on x86

            <code>&amp;rest</code> argument lists can be allocated on the stack
            (instead of on the heap), and be freed automatically when the
            function exits.

            An experimental way of delivering programs as <strong>standalone
            executables</strong> has been posted to the cmucl-imp mailing list.
            The idea consists of stuffing the lisp image into an ELF section of
            the runtime, and extracting it on startup. This makes it possible
            to use CMUCL to produce an executable program that has no runtime
            dependencies other than the platform's standard shared libraries.

            An implementation of <strong>fwrappers</strong> has been committed,
            and the profiling and trace facilities have been modified to use
            it. This provides a more uniform way of implementing mechanisms
            that use function encapsulation.

            CMUCL now supports <strong>package locks</strong>, with an API very
            similar to the same feature in Allegro CL. Attempts to change the
            structure of a locked package (for example by changing its export
            or use list) lead to a continuable PACKAGE-LOCKED-ERROR being
            signaled. Symbols in a package whose definition-lock is enabled are
            protected from redefinition. The
            <code>EXT:WITHOUT-PACKAGE-LOCKS</code> macro can be used to execute
            forms with all package locks disabled.

            <strong>Control stack overflow checking</strong> has been
            implemented for x86-FreeBSD and x86-Linux, thanks to Gerd
            Moellmann. Previously, code that overflowed the control stack (for
            example due to unchecked recursion) would cause CMUCL to crash with
            a segmentation violation; it will now lead to a continuable
            STORAGE-ERROR being signaled.

            Support for generalized function names has been added, thanks to

            like <code>FOO</code>, and the special case of <code>(SETF
            FOO)</code>. This patch allows general names of the form <code>(FOO
            BAR BAZ)</code>, which should be particularly useful for naming
