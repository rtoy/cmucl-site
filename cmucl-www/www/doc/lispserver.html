<p> The multiprocessing capabilities in the x86 versions of CMUCL allow it
    to operate as a lisp server. This can be useful in a situation where
    you wish to execute a number of small scripts, where the overhead of
    launching a separate CMUCL instance would be penalizing. For a real
    application you would have to take security considerations into
    account. </p>

<p> Craig Brozefsky has developed a prototype application called <a href =
    "http://sanpietro.red-bean.com/~craig/qcmu/">qcmu</a> which generalizes
    this technique. It allows users to obtain either a REPL or to execute a
    script on a CMUCL server. qcmu uses a client-server protocol which
    incorporates authentication mechanisms. </p>
