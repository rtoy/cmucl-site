          <strong>Documentation</strong>: Fast dumping and loading of data
        </div>
        <p>
          Handling persistence / marshaling and unmarshaling / pickling There
          are several ways of saving and restoring state in CMUCL:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ensure that your data structures know how to print themselves
          readably, by defining print-functions for your structures, and by
          specializing the <code class="function-name">PRINT-OBJECT</code>
          generic function for your classes. You can then use the Common Lisp
          printer to save objects in ASCII form, and the Common Lisp reader to
          load them. This technique is likely to be very slow on large amounts
          of data, since the printer and reader are not very efficient. It will
          be particularly slow when serializing integers and floats, since the
          conversion from binary to ASCII format and back is very inefficient.
          However, this is the only technique that saves your data in a
          portable format.
          </li>
          <li>Ensure that all your objects are externalizable by specializing
          the generic function <code class=
          "function-name">MAKE-LOAD-FORM</code> for your classes and
          structures. You can then use <code class=
          "function-name">COMPILE-FILE</code> to create a FASL file for your
          data. <a href="http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/sec_3-2-4-4.html">
            Section 3.2.4.4 of CLtS</a> specifies the constraints on portable
            externalization using MAKE-LOAD-FORM.
          </li>
          <li>Save a lisp image, using the CMUCL function <code class=
          "function-name">EXT:SAVE-LISP</code>. You can restart this image
          later, using the <code>-core</code> commandline option to CMUCL. This
          method is easy to implement and fast, but doesn't allow you to be
          selective about what you save; you serialize the entire lisp world.
          </li>
          <li>Use the following CMUCL-specific binary loading and dumping code,
          which is similar to the preceding technique, but doesn't require you
          to define MAKE-LOAD-FORM for everything. 
          <!-- how about arrays and so on? -->
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
          Portability of dumps
        </h2>
        <p>
          There is a compromise between efficiency and portability of your
          dumps: the most efficient techniques are those that save data in a
          form that is closest to the in-memory representation used by CMUCL,
          but this in-memory representation changes as CMUCL evolves. The only
          technique that creates a portable dump (that you can read in another
          Common Lisp implementation on a different platform) is the first:
          saving to ASCII. All the other techniques save data in binary format,
          and so will not be portable to another hardware platform (consider
          for example big-endian/little-endian issues). The least portable
          technique is saving an image; since CMUCL images are tightly bound to
          their runtime, you won't be able to use a saved image with a future
          release of CMUCL.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two other techniques are a little less tied to the exact CMUCL
          version number, but you shouldn't count on them producing data that
          is portable from one release to another. This is because the FASL
          file format can change occasionally, which will mean that an old FASL
          file will no longer be readable by the new CMUCL. The fastest way to
          dump binary data to disk (and retrieving it) under cmucl is through
          the following code, posted some time ago by <a href=
          "http://www.mail-archive.com/cmucl-help@cons.org/msg00547.html">Pierre
          Mai on cmucl-help</a>. It uses the compiler's fasl (fast loading)
          facility:
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
(defvar *internal-value-passer*)
(defun bindump (object filename)
  (let ((file (c::open-fasl-file (pathname filename) nil t)))
    (unwind-protect
        (let ((c::*coalesce-constants* nil)
              (c::*dump-only-valid-structures* nil)
              (c::*cold-load-dump* t))
          (c::dump-fop 'lisp::fop-normal-load file)
          (c::dump-object `(setq *internal-value-passer* ',object) file)
          (c::dump-fop 'lisp::fop-eval-for-effect file))
      (c::close-fasl-file file nil)))
  t)
(defun binload (filename)
  (let ((*internal-value-passer* nil))
    (load filename :verbose nil :print nil)
    *internal-value-passer*)))
</pre>
        <p>
          The object argument to bindump can be pretty much anything. I've
          tried with structs, lists of vectors and symbols etc. it just works.
        </p>
