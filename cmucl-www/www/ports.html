@@HEADING(software which runs in CMUCL)


<p> This page contains an (incomplete) list of freely redistributable
    software which is known to run in CMUCL (to know what platforms CMUCL
    runs on, see the <a href = "platforms.html">platforms page</a>). </p>

    
<h3>Networking </h3>

<ul>
<li> <a href = "https://www.cliki.net/araneida">Araneida</a> is a small
     <strong>extensible web server</strong> written in Common Lisp with
     CMUCL extensions, under a BSD-sans-advertising licence. It hooks into
     the CMUCL event loop rather than using multithreading, and is designed
     to run behind a caching proxy such as <a href =
     "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html">Apache's
     mod_proxy</a>. </li>

<li> <a href =
     "http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/cl-http.html">
     CL-HTTPD</a> is an advanced web server implemented in Common Lisp.
<!--
     There is a <a href =
     "ftp://cvs2.cons.org/pub/lisp/cmucl/ports/cl-http/"> CMUCL
     port</a>. The licence is unfortunately very restrictive. 
-->
</li>

<li> <a href = "http://clorb.sourceforge.net/">CLORB</a> is a <a href =
     "https://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a> ORB for Common Lisp. It is still
     under development, but the client-side functionality works with CMUCL
     (server-side is currently limited to single-threaded polling). </li>

<li> The <a href = "https://www.cliki.net">CLiki</a> is a <a href =
     "http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/MeatballWiki"> wiki-like</a>
     system allowing collaborative web authoring, developed in CL. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Graphics</h3>

<ul>
<li> <strong>CLX</strong> is an implementation of the client side of the
     X11 protocol in Common Lisp (ie it plays the role of libX11 for C
     programs). The CMUCL version incorporates patches for X authorization
     which are not included in the official release. </li>

<li> <a href = "http://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/">McCLIM</a> is a rapidly improving
     free implementation of the CLIM specification. This library allows
     rapid development of powerful inspector-type user interfaces. </li>

<li> <a href = "http://garnetlisp.sourceforge.net/">Garnet</a> is a
     <strong>sophisticated widget set</strong> developed at the User
     Interface Software Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Garnet aims to
     facilitate the construction of interactive graphical user interfaces.
     It includes an implementation of a prototype-instance object model, a
     portable graphics layer for X11 and MacOS, automatic constraint
     maintenance, and interactive design tools. The <a href =
     "ftp://ftp.csl.sri.com/pub/users/gilham/garnet/">version distributed
     by Fred Gilham</a> incorporates a few patches for 8bit displays and
     various bugfixes. <a href =
     "http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/rvb/software/plot-2d/">Plot-2d</a> is a
     plotting gadget for Garnet, that makes it easy to visualize
     two-dimensional data. </li>

<li> <strong>CLM</strong> is a Motif&reg; subsystem for CMUCL. It can
     be compiled with the freely available <a href =
     "https://www.lesstif.org/">LessTif</a> implementation. CLM is used in
     the graphical interface to the CMUCL debugger and inspector. </li>

<!--
<li> As its name suggests, <a href =
     "http://www.arch.usyd.edu.au/~thorsten/lisp/lisp.html">Lisp-Tk</a> is

     "https://sourceforge.net/projects/clg">Espen Johnsen's clg</a> binds
     directly to the GTk event loop via the CMUCL FFI (GNU LGPL). <a href =
     "https://www.cliki.net/cl-gtk">
     Gilbert Baumann's (older) binding</a> uses a client-server model to avoid
     problems with mixing two event loops.  </li>

<li> <a href = "https://sourceforge.net/projects/glos/">GLOS</a> is an
     OpenGL subset developed in Common Lisp. It features Gourad shading,
     Phong lighting, Zbuffer/clipping, near and far. </li>
     
<li> <a href =
     "http://www-cgi.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/gui/clue/">
     CLUE</a> (Common Lisp User-Interface Environment) is an extension of
     CLX which provides a simple, object-based toolkit (similar to Xt),
     using CLOS. It provides simple object-oriented classes and stream I/O
     facilites. <!-- There is a <a href =
     "ftp://cvs2.cons.org/pub/lisp/cmucl/ports/clue.pw/">
     CMUCL port</a>. --> CLIO is a set of widgets built on top of CLUE, and
     Pictures is a CLOS-based interface to CLIO. </li>

<li> <a href = "http://www.geocities.ws/pgplot_cl/">PGPLOT-CL</A> is an 
     CMUCL interface to the PGPLOT 2-d scientific plotting library. </li>

<li> The <a href =

     renders a directed acyclic graph to Postscript. It consists of a set
     of Lisp routines which uses the same algorithm as the ISI Grapher. The
     fonts and box drawing style are user-definable. </li>    
</ul>


<h3>Mathematics</h3>

<ul>
<li> The <a href = "http://series.sourceforge.net/">series package</a>
     (described in Appendix A of <a href =
     "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/cltl2.html">
     Common Lisp: the Language, 2nd edition</a>) is a set of macros which
     allow the programmer to program in a functional style (using
     compositions of functions operating on series or vectors or streams of
     data elements), without incurring the efficiency costs typically
     associated with such a programming style. The macros generate
     iterative loops. </li>

<li> There is an improved version of f2cl, a Fortran to Common Lisp
     compiler, in <a href = "http://clocc.sourceforge.net/">CLOCC</a>. </li>

     package for Common Lisp. It consists of CLOS bindings to the BLAS and
     LAPACK linear algebra packages. </li>

<li> <a href = "http://maxima.sourceforge.net/">Maxima</a> is a
     computer algebra system implemented in Common Lisp. It is a derivative
     of the Macsyma system, which is released under the GNU GPL. Maxima is
     primarily intended to be used with the GCL Common Lisp implementation,
     but recent releases also work with CMUCL. </li>
         
<li> <a href = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a> is a
     semi-automatic theorem prover embedded in an applicative dialect of

<h3>Misc</h3>

<ul>

<!--
<li> <a href = "http://alpha.onshored.com/lisp-software/">UncommonSQL</a> is
     a CommonSQL-like binding to the <a href =
     "http://www.PostgreSQL.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href =
     "http://www.MySQL.com/">MySQL</a> and Oracle DBMSes. It provides a
     functional SQL syntax and an object-to-relational mapping based on
     CLOS. CommonSQL is based on <a href =
     "http://www.pmsf.de/resources/lisp/MaiSQL.html">MaiSQL</a>. </li>
-->

<li> <a href = "http://www.cl-xml.org/">CL-XML</a> implements data stream
     parsing and serialization for the XML, XML Query and XPath standards.
     The XML processor includes a conformant, validating, namespace-aware
     model-based parser. It supports, in particular, namespace-aware
     DTD-based validation. The XPATH module comprises LISP bindings for the
     XML Path library, an S-expression-based namespace-aware path model,
     and a macro-based path model compiler which implements an
     XPATH-algebra. The XQUERY module comprises LISP bindings for the XML
     Query library, an S-expression-based query model which incorporates
     the XPATH facilities, and a macro-based query compiler. The base CLOS
     model implements the XML Query Data Model in a class hierarchy which
     presents an Infoset compatible programming interface. CL-XML runs with
     CVS versions of CMUCL as of around 2003-08. 

<!--
<li> A port of the <strong>XML parser</strong> from <a href = "https://www.franz.com/">Franz
     Inc</a> is available from <a href =
     "ftp://cvs2.cons.org/pub/lisp/cmucl/ports/xmlutils/">ports/xmlutils</a>.
     The port does not support Unicode, since CMUCL has no support for
     extended character sets. </li>

<li> <a href = "http://clocc.sourceforge.net/">CLOCC</a> includes
     <tt>mk-defsystem</tt>, an implementation of the Common Lisp
     <tt>DEFSYSTEM</tt> utility (which occupies a similar position to
     <tt>make</tt> in C/Unix projects). </li>
