@@HEADING(how to get CMUCL)

<p> The latest formal release of CMUCL (binaries and source) is available
    from the various download sites, in the <tt>release</tt> directory.
    For each supported platform there are two bzipped tar archives, one
    containing the base system, and the other (with <tt>extra</tt> in the
    name) containing additional files supporting CLX, Hemlock, Gray streams
    and so on.

<p> The download sites are: </p>

<dl>
<dt> <a href="ftp://ftp.common-lisp.net/pub/project/cmucl/">ftp.common-lisp.net:/pub/project/cmucl</a>
<dd> The primary CMUCL machine, located in the United States. You can also
     access the same files <a href =
     "http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/">using HTTP</a>. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.averillpark.net/cmucl/">ftp.averillpark.net/cmucl</a> 
<dd> A complete mirror located in the United States. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/cmucl/">
     ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/cmucl</a> 
<dd> A complete mirror located in England. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "http://www.pmsf.de/pub/cmucl/">www.pmsf.de/pub/cmucl</a>
<dd> A partial mirror of the releases and ports sections, which should
provide good bandwidth across Europe and the USA. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "http://www.pmsf.net/cmucl/">www.pmsf.net/cmucl</a>
<dd> The primary mirror and master rsync server, but only has limited
outbound bandwidth. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.cn.freebsd.org/pub/cmucl/">ftp.cn.freebsd.org/pub/cmucl</a>
<dd> A complete mirror, which should have reasonable bandwidth from Asia. </dd>
</dl>


<p> Binaries built from source more recent than the latest release are
    available from the download mirrors in the <tt>binaries</tt> directory.
    These binaries contain bugfixes and new features that are not in the
    release binaries, but have had less testing. </p>

<p> Binaries providing experimental features (such as long floats), or
    built with non-standard features or subsystems, are available in the
    <tt>experimental</tt> directory. These haven't had much testing. </p>

    disclaimer</a> for details of the <em>absence of warranty</em>

<h2>Alternative binary distributions</h2>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <a href = "http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>
    port (<tt>ports/lang/cmucl</tt>) for the x86, thanks to Martin Cracauer. </p>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <tt>.deb</tt> <a href =
    "http://www.debian.org/Packages/stable/devel/cmucl.html" >package</a>
    for <a href = "http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> on x86,
    thanks to Peter Van Eynde. Note that the Debian binaries are not
    exactly equivalent to the cons.org binaries; they include a number of
    modifications. In particular, they are not binary-compatible with the
    cons.org binaries, so you cannot share FASL files between them. You can
    use <a href = "http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">Alien</a> to
    <strong>convert the debian packages into RPMs</strong> to be installed
    on RedHat or SuSE installations:

<pre>
    # alien --to-rpm cmucl-version.deb
    # rpm -i cmucl-version.rpm
</pre>

<p> CMUCL is <a href = "http://www.caddr.com/lisp/">available in RPM
    format</a> for Red Hat/x86, thanks for Miles Egan. The RPMs should be
    equivalent to the official release tarballs, but may be easier to
    install for some users. </p>

<p> CMUCL is available as a package for the <a href =
    "http://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> distribution. The package is
    named cmucl-bin, and is in the dev-lisp category. </p>



<h2>Anonymous CVS access</h2>

<p> The CMUCL source code can also be obtained by anonymous CVS from
    <tt>common-lisp.net</tt>. It can be accessed using a command such as

<pre>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/cmucl/cvsroot login
    &lt;enter anonymous as password&gt;
    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/cmucl/cvsroot co src
</pre>

<p> The anoncvs tree is available using anonymous rsync at
    <tt>rsync://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/cvsroot</tt>. This is
    probably the most network-friendly way of keeping up to date with the
    current sources, since the rsync protocol is very efficient. Keeping
    your own local CVS tree also makes cvs operations much faster than when
    you contact the main repository. Sample usage:

<pre>
    rsync -avz rsync://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/cvsroot /var/cvs/CVS-cmucl
</pre>

<p> You can also <a href =
    "http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/src/?cvsroot=cmucl">view
    the repository via viewCVS</a>, and access histories and diffs between
    versions. 

<p> There are CVS tags for the latest releases, named <tt>RELEASE_18e</tt>,
    <tt>RELEASE_18d</tt>, <tt>RELEASE_18c</tt>, <tt>RELEASE_18b</tt> and
    <tt>RELEASE_18a</tt>. </p>

<p> Thanks for using CMUCL! </p>
