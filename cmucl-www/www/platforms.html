@@HEADING(what does it run on?)

<p> CMUCL should work on the following combinations of operating system and
    architecture:

<dl>
<dt> Linux/x86 </dt>

<dd> The 19c release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The binaries are compiled against version 2.2 of the GNU C Library
     (glibc2.2), but also work with glibc2.3. The runtime support for the
     CMUCL Motif interface is dynamically linked, so you will need the
     Motif or Lesstif libraries (preferably version 2) installed on your
     system to use it. The binaries should run with any Linux kernel after
     2.0 (but beware early kernels in the 2.4 series, which had poor
     virtual memory characteristics).

     <p> There are problems running CMUCL on certain kernels that are built
     with address-space randomization techniques, such as certain Fedora
     kernels. If you run into problems, please use a vanilla kernel.

     <p> There are known problems running CMUCL on 2.4 kernels using certain
     configurations of the HIGHMEM support (this option allows larger
     process address spaces, and certain distributions ship kernels with
     these patches enabled). The <tt>CONFIG_64GB</tt> and
     <tt>CONFIG_1GB</tt> options work fine.

     <p> CMUCL is known not to run under libsafe, whose system call
     interposition mechanism interferes with the foreign function
     interface. CMUCL does not run on kernels with &quot;hardening&quot;
     patches such as grsecurity, since their all-the-world-is-C
     assumptions are too strong.
</dd>

<dt> FreeBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> The 19c release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The 19c binaries should work with FreeBSD releases 4.x and
     -current (5.x). </dd>

<dt> NetBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> The 19c release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The 19c binaries should work with NetBSD releases xx and yy. </dd>

<dt> OpenBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> There are currently no 19c binaries for OpenBSD (it seems that address
     space randomization techniques introduced with recent versions of
     OpenBSD interfere with CMUCL's memory management). The 18e release
     binaries should work on any i486 or better processor. The 18e binaries
     were build on OpenBSD 3.1. </dd>

<dt> Solaris/SPARC </dt>

<dd> the 19c binaries should work with SunOS 5.5 or later (also known
     respectively as Solaris 2.5, Solaris 7 and later). They require an
     UltraSPARC processor. If you have an ancient SPARC machine, you can
     get the non-v9 version of the 18e release. If you have an UltraSPARC
     the command <tt>uname&nbsp;-m</tt> will say <tt>sun4u</tt>, if you
     have an older machine such as a SparcStation it will probably say
     <tt>sun4m</tt>. </dd>

<dt> PowerPC/MacOS X </dt>
<dd> The 19c release binaries work with MacOS X version 10.4 (Tiger),
     10.3 (Panther) and 10.2 (Jaguar). </dd>

<dt> Alpha/Linux </dt>
<dd> There are no 19c binaries for Alpha. The 18e binaries are known to
     work on ev56 and ev6 machines, running Linux 2.4.x. </dd>

<dt> IRIX/MIPS </dt>
<dd> There are no 19c binaries for IRIX. The 18e release binaries are known
     to work with Irix 6.2, and should work on any later version. They use
     the o32 ABI. </dd>

<dt> HPUX/HPPA </dt>
<dd> this port has not been maintained for quite a while, so
     you'll have to go back to the 18a release to find binaries for this
     platform. </dd>

<dt> x86/win32 </dt>
<dd> There is an ongoing effort to port CMUCL to win32, but no public
     source code or binaries are available at present.. </dd>
</dl>


<p> The <a href = "http://sbcl.sf.net/">SBCL implementation</a> (a fork
    from CMUCL) runs on some platforms that CMUCL doesn't currently
    support, such as Linux/SPARC, Linux/PowerPC, Linux/Alpha -- check their
    web site for current status. </p>


<h3>Platform-specific build options</h3>

<p> The builds for x86 platforms include a generational conservative
garbage collector (this can be tested for through the presence of the
<tt>:gencgc</tt> feature). The other architectures use a stop-and-copy
garbage collector. </p>

<p> The x86 builds also include basic multiprocessing support (this can be
tested for through the presence of the <tt>:mp</tt> feature). The
implementation is based on stack groups, ie user-level threads, and not on
kernel threads. The interface is very similar to the <a href =
"http://www.mikemac.com/mike/clim/clim-sys.html">CLIM-SYS
specification</a>. </p>
