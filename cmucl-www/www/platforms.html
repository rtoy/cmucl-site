@@HEADING(what does it run on?)

<p> CMUCL should work on the following combinations of operating system and
    architecture:

<dl>
<dt> Linux/x86 </dt>
<dd> The 18e release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The 18e binaries are compiled against version 2.1 of the GNU C Library
     (glibc2.1), but also work with glibc2.2. They should
     run with any Linux kernel after 2.0 (but beware early kernels in the
     2.4 series, which had poor virtual memory characteristics). There are
     known problems running CMUCL on kernels using certain configurations of the
     HIGHMEM support (this option allows larger process address spaces, and
     certain distributions ship kernels with these patches enabled). The
     <tt>CONFIG_64GB</tt> and <tt>CONFIG_1GB</tt> options work fine. The
     runtime support for the CMUCL Motif interface is statically linked, so
     you won't need the Motif libraries installed on your system.

     <p> CMUCL is known not to run under libsafe, whose system call
     interposition mechanism interferes with the foreign function
     interface. CMUCL does not run on kernels with &quot;hardening&quot;
     patches such as grsecurity, since their all-the-world-is-C
     assumptions are too strong.
</dd>

<dt> FreeBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd>
     The 18e release binaries should work on any i586 or better processor.
     The 18e binaries should work with FreeBSD releases 4.x and
     -current (5.x). </dd>

<dt> OpenBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> The 18e release binaries should work on any i486 or better processor.
     The 18e binaries were build on OpenBSD 3.1. </dd>

<dt> NetBSD/x86 </dt>
<dd> there are binaries for NetBSD 1.5.2 in the <tt>experimental</tt>
     directory of the download sites. Unfortunately NetBSD doesn't provide
     access to the faulting memory address in SIGSEGV handlers, hence the
     generational GC can't use a hardware-based write-barrier in order to
     reduce the need to track pointers from older generations to newer
     ones, resulting in degraded GC performance. Also, the runtime has to
     work around a limitation in the <tt>mmap</tt> system call, which
     refuses to map zones larger than 128MiB.  </dd>

<dt> Solaris/SPARC </dt>
<dd> the 18e binaries should work with SunOS 5.5, 5.7 and
     5.8 (also known respectively as Solaris 2.5, Solaris 7 and Solaris 8).
     If you have an UltraSPARC processor you can get the <tt>v9</tt>
     binaries, which use instructions which are only present on SPARC-v9
     implementations; otherwise you should get the binaries without
     <tt>v9</tt> in the name of the tarball. If you have an UltraSPARC the
     command <tt>uname&nbsp;-m</tt> will say <tt>sun4u</tt>, if you have an
     older machine such as a SparcStation it will probably say
     <tt>sun4m</tt>. </dd>

<dt> Alpha/Linux </dt>
<dd> The 18e binaries are known to work on ev56 and ev6 machines, running
     Linux 2.4.x.  </dd>

<dt> IRIX/MIPS </dt>
<dd> The 18e release binaries are known to work with Irix 6.2, and should
     work on any later version. They use the o32 ABI. </dd>

<dt> HPUX/HPPA </dt>
<dd> this port has not been maintained for quite a while, so
     you'll have to go back to the 18a release to find binaries for this
     platform. </dd>
</dl>

<p> There is some ongoing work on the creation of a PowerPC backend,
    targeting LinuxPPC. There is no win32 port of CMUCL, and making this
    port would involve a considerable amount of work. The <a href =
    "http://sbcl.sf.net/">SBCL implementation</a> (a fork from CMUCL) runs
    on some platforms that CMUCL doesn't currently support, such as
    Linux/SPARC, Linux/PowerPC, Linux/Alpha -- check their web site for
    current status. </p>


<h3>Platform-specific build options</h3>

<p> The builds for x86 platforms include a generational conservative
garbage collector (this can be tested for through the presence of the
<tt>:gencgc</tt> feature). The other architectures use a stop-and-copy
garbage collector. </p>

<p> The x86 builds also include basic multiprocessing support (this can be
tested for through the presence of the <tt>:mp</tt> feature). The
implementation is based on stack groups, ie user-level threads, and not on
kernel threads. The interface is very similar to the <a href =
"http://www.mikemac.com/mike/clim/clim-sys.html">CLIM-SYS
specification</a>. </p>
