<dd> The January 2009 snapshots include support for X87 and SSE2.
CMUCL will automatically detect if the chip supports SSE2 or not.  If
so, the SSE2 core will be used.  If not, the X87 (legacy) core will be
used.  For special cases, the user may override this automatic
selection by using the <emph>-fpu</emph> flag.

The SSE2 core should work somewhat better than the X87 core on chips
that support both.  In particular some round-off issues are gone, and
complex arithmetic with SSE2 is faster and sometimes much faster than
X87.


<dt>2008-05-01</dt>
<dd> CMUCL 19e has been released. The release notes and binaries for the
supported platforms are available from the <tt>release/19e</tt> directory
of the download sites.
