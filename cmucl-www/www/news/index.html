<dd> Anoncvs access has been restored. The 19a pre-release testing phase
will start soon. 

<dt>2004-06-01</dt>
<dd> Anoncvs access to projects on common-lisp.net has been disabled,
following the recently discovered vulnerabilities in the CVS code base. 

<dt>2004-05-05</dt>
<dd> The <strong>May snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded, for
sparcv9/Solaris, x86/FreeBSD and x86/Linux.

<dt>2004-05-04</dt>
<dd> Support for an separate stack for delivering signals (via the
<tt>sigaltstack()</tt> system call) has been committed. This makes it
possible to trap overflows of the C stack and print a diagnostic message
before aborting. 

<dt>2004-04-22</dt>
<dd> The behaviour of <tt class="function-name">EXT:LOAD-FOREIGN</tt> when
called with a single shared library has been changed to call <tt
class="function-name">SYS::LOAD-OBJECT-FILE</tt> directly, without invoking
the linker as previously. 

<dt>2004-04-06</dt>
<dd> Improved support for <strong>source-location recording</strong> has been
contributed by Helmut Eller. This improves the support for
a FIND-DEFINITION like facility in editors for classes, generic functions
and methods.

<dt>2004-04-04</dt>
<dd> Support for <strong>efficient modular arithmetic</strong> on x86 and
SPARC platforms has been ported from SBCL by Raymond Toy. This allows the
compiler to generate better code for certain operations on 32-bit
quantities.

<dt>2004-04-02</dt>
<dd> The <strong>April snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded, for
sparcv9/Solaris, x86/FreeBSD and x86/Linux.

<dt>2004-03-20</dt>
<dd> The CMUCL CVS repository is back online at <a href =
"http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/">common-lisp.net</a>. Thanks to the
site admins for providing this service! This will lead to changes to
CVS access and to the primary download host.

<dt>2004-01</dt>
<dd> The CMUCL CVS server suffered a disk crash, and the project repository
has been offline for a while. Apologies for the interruption.
