@@HEADING(a high-performance, free Common Lisp implementation)

<p> CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
    which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
    Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features: </p>

<ul>
<li> Support for static arrays that are never moved by GC but are
properly removed when no longer referenced. </li>

<li> Unicode support, including many of the most common external
formats such as UTF-8 and support for handling Unix, DOS, and Mac
end-of-line schemes. </li>

<li> native double-double floats including complex double-double
floats and specialized arrays for double-double floats and and complex
double-double floats that give approximately 106 bits (32 digits) of
precision. </li>

<li> a <strong>sophisticated native-code compiler</strong> which is capable
     of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed
     with C compilers. </li>

<li> generational garbage collection and <strong>multiprocessing
     capability</strong> on the x86 ports. </li>

<li> a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and
     system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and
     direct access to Unix system calls. </li>

<li> support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
     calls. </li>

<li> an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
     includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol. </li>

<li> a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
     code profiler. </li>

<li> an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
     graphical widget library (Garnet). </li>

<li> programmer-extensible input and output streams. </li>

<li> an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp. </li>

<li> <strong>freely redistributable</strong>: free, with full source code
     (most of which is in the public domain) and no strings attached (and
     no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating systems, CMUCL is
     maintained and improved by a team of volunteers collaborating over the
     Internet. </li>

</ul>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Snapshot 2011-02</strong>
<dd>
 The 2011-02 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> <code>EXT::DESCRIBE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</code> was not exported.</li>

  <li> <code>TRACE</code> was erroneously allowing encapsulation when
   tracing local flet/labels functions.  This doesn't actually trace
   anything. An error is now signaled in this case.  If you are sure,
   you can specify <code>:ENCAPSULATE NIL</code> to disable
   encapsulation.  
 </ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Snapshot 2011-01</strong>
<dd>
 The 2011-01 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> Initial support for Solaris/x86.  CMUCL will run on Solaris/x86
       with all features available. </li>
  <li> <code>UNINTERN</code> no longer removes the wrong symbol.  <code>UNINTERN</code> would
       remove the symbol when inherited from another package although it
       should not.
  <li> <code>DEFSTRUCT</code> allows multiple keyword constructors as required by the spec..
  </li>
  <li> <code>SUBSEQ</code> with an end index less than the start index sometimes
  crashes CMUCL. Now, signal an error if the boudns are not
  valid. 
  </li>
  <li> Localization support was causing many calls to stat trying to
  find non-existent translation files.  This has been fixed so
  that the results are cached.  (If new translations are added,
  the cache will need to be cleared or cmucl restarted.)  This
  change cuts building time by half on Solaris/sparc.
  </li>
  <li> On NetBSD, function-end breakpoints, especially for
  tail-recursive functions, are working now.
  </li>
  <li> On NetBSD, display of FP numbers (sse2 and x87) during tracing
  has been corrected.  Previously, random values were displayed.
  </li>
  <li> Executables images can now be created on NetBSD again.</li>
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt><strong>20b patch 000</strong>

 A critical bug in <code>REALPART</code> and <code>IMAGPART</code> has
 been fixed in the 2010-11 snapshot.  A <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/release/20b/patches/cmucl-20b-patch-000.tar.gz">patch</a> is provided now to fix
 this issue in the 20b release.  <a href="install.html">Installation</a>

<h2>What is Common Lisp?</h2>

<p> Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and
    <em>explorative programming</em>. The language has a dynamic
    semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada.
    It features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental
    development environment, a module system, a large number of
    powerful data structures, a large standard library of useful
    functions, a sophisticated object system supporting multiple
    inheritance and generic functions, an exception system,
    user-defined types and a macro system which allows programmers to
    extend the language. </p>

<blockquote>
Pascal is for building pyramids -- imposing, breathtaking
structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp
is for building organisms ... <br> <i>Alan Perlis</i>
