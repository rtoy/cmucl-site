<dt><strong>20c released</strong></dt>
<dd>CMUCL 20c has been released, For information on the changes between
20c and 20b, we refer the reader to the <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/wiki/ReleaseNotes20c">20c release notes</a>.

Because of the release, there will not be a 2011-11 snapshot. . 


<dt>Snapshot 2011-10
<dd>
  The 2011-10 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
  details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
  snapshot and the previous snapshot.

  <ul>
   <li> Command-line flags <code>-read-only-space-size</code>,
   <code>-static-space-size</code>, <code>-control-stack-size</code>,
   and <code>-binding-stack-size</code> have been addded to control
   the size of the corresponding region. The default size of each is
   unchanged.</li>
  <li> Add -O option to <code>build.sh</code>.</li>
  <li> The format of the file-comments has changed somewhat. The
   Header keyword is retained, but the git short SHA1 hash is used for
   the revision. </li>
  </ul>
</dd>


<dt>2011-09-20</dt>
<dd> The CMUCL CVS repository has been converted to git and is now
available. You can browse the repository using the  <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/browser">Browse
Source</a>, or you can visit <a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/cmucl/cmucl.git;a=summary;js=1">CMUCL gitweb</a> for a different view. This page
also includes links necessary for cloning the repository. (For
commiters, be sure to put your userid in the ssh link.)  

    The CVS repository will still be available, but will not allow checkins anymore.

    Git is integrated with Trac so the commit messages can refer to
    and even close Trac tickets. If the commit messages contains text
    like

<pre>
        command #1
    	command #1, #2
    	command #1 & #2
    	command #1 and #2
</pre>

    then the given command is applied to the specified
    tickets. Instead of the short-hand syntax above, you can also use

<pre>
        command ticket:1
    	command ticket:1, ticket:2
    	command ticket:1 & ticket:2
    	command ticket:1 and ticket:2
</pre>

    The available commands (not case-sensitive) are:

<dl>
 <dt> close, closed, closes, fix, fixed, fixes</dt>
 <dd> The specified issue numbers are closed with the contents of this
 commit message being added to it. </dd> 
 <dt>references, refs, addresses, re, see</dt>
 <dd> The specified issue numbers are left in their current status,
 but the contents of this commit message are added to their
 notes. </dd>
</dl>


<dt>Snapshot 2011-09</dt>
<dd> The 2011-09 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this snapshot and the previous snapshot.

 <ul>
  <li> ASDF2 updated to version 2.017.</li>
  <li> Improve type propagation for <code>LOAD-TIME-VALUE</code>.</li>
  <li> Getting documentation of a structure via <code>DOCUMENTATION</code> no
  longer signals an error.</li> 
  <li> Reduce unnecessary consing of <code>SAP</code>s in <code>ROOM</code>.</li>
  <li> Make stack overflow checking actually work on Mac OS X. The
  implementation had the <code>:STACK-CHECKING</code> feature, but it didn't
  actually prevent stack overflows from crashing lisp.</li>
  <li> Fix rounding of numbers larger than a fixnum. </li>
 </ul>
</dd>


<dt>Snapshot 2011-08</dt>
<dd> There was no snapshot for this month. </dd>


<dt>Snapshot 2011-07</dt>
<dd> The 2011-07 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
snapshot and the previous snapshot.  

 <ul>
  <li> Unicode database updated to Unicode 6.0.0.</li>
  <li> ASDF2 updated to version 2.016.1</li>
  <li> Add <code>LISP:LOAD-ALL-UNICODE-DATA</code> to load all the unicode
  information into core. This is useful for creating an executable
  image that does not need unidata.bin.</li>
  <li> CMUCL no longer exits if you specify a core file with an
  executable image. A warning is printed instead and the core file is
  used.</li>
  <li> Trac #43 has been fixed in a better way. The previous fix was
  incorrect and causes some Unicode tests to fail.</li> 
 </ul>
</dd>


<dt>Snapshot 2011-06</dt>
<dd> The 2011-06 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
snapshot and the previous snapshot.  

 <ul>
  <li> <code>:CMUCL</code> is now in <code>*FEATURES*</code></li>
  <li> Added command line option, <code>-unidata</code>, to allow user to specify
  the location and name of the unidata.bin file. This is used instead
  of the default location.</li>
  <li> Opening a file whose name contains "[" with <code>:IF-EXISTS
  :NEW-VERSION</code> no longer causes an error. </li> 
 </ul>
</dd>


<dt>Snapshot 2011-05</dt>
<dd> There was no snapshot in May, partly due to the ongoing upgrade
on common-lisp.net. </dd>


<dt>Snapshot 2011-04</dt>
<dd> The 2011-04 snapshot has been released. See the release notes for
details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the this
snapshot and the previous snapshot.  

 <ul>
  <li> In <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>, the second return value is now non-nil if
  there are style warnings. Previously, style warnings were
  erroneously ignored.</li>
  <li> ASDF has been updated to version 2.014.1 </li>
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-03
<dd>
 The 2011-02 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> In <code>COMPILE-FILE</code>, the <code>:OUTPUT-FILE</code> can
    also be a stream.  CMUCL was erroneously signaling an error..</li>

  <li> <code>(OPEN f :DIRECTION :IO :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL)</code> no
    longer signals an error if the file <code>f</code> does not exist.
    It returns <code>NIL</code> now.</li>
  <li> In some situations the compiler could not constant fold <code>SQRT</code>
    calls because <code>KERNEL:%SQRT</code> was not defined on x86
    with SSE2.  This is fixed now.</li>
  <li> In an earlier snapshot to add support for character name
    completion with <a
    href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>, a bug was
    introduced where cmucl could no 
    longer read <code>#\latin_small_letter_a</code>.  This is fixed
    in this version.<li>
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-02
<dd>
 The 2011-02 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> <code>EXT::DESCRIBE-EXTERNAL-FORMAT</code> was not exported.</li>

  <li> <code>TRACE</code> was erroneously allowing encapsulation when
   tracing local flet/labels functions.  This doesn't actually trace
   anything. An error is now signaled in this case.  If you are sure,
   you can specify <code>:ENCAPSULATE NIL</code> to disable
   encapsulation.  
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Snapshot 2011-01
<dd>
 The 2011-01 snapshot has been released.  See the release notes for
 details, but here is a quick summary of the changes between the
 this snapshot and the previous snapshot.
 <ul>
  <li> Initial support for Solaris/x86.  CMUCL will run on Solaris/x86
       with all features available. </li>
  <li> <code>UNINTERN</code> no longer removes the wrong symbol.  <code>UNINTERN</code> would
       remove the symbol when inherited from another package although it
       should not.
  <li> <code>DEFSTRUCT</code> allows multiple keyword constructors as required by the spec..
  </li>
  <li> <code>SUBSEQ</code> with an end index less than the start index sometimes
  crashes CMUCL. Now, signal an error if the boudns are not
  valid. 
  </li>
  <li> Localization support was causing many calls to stat trying to
  find non-existent translation files.  This has been fixed so
  that the results are cached.  (If new translations are added,
  the cache will need to be cleared or cmucl restarted.)  This
  change cuts building time by half on Solaris/sparc.
  </li>
  <li> On NetBSD, function-end breakpoints, especially for
  tail-recursive functions, are working now.
  </li>
  <li> On NetBSD, display of FP numbers (sse2 and x87) during tracing
  has been corrected.  Previously, random values were displayed.
  </li>
  <li> Executables images can now be created on NetBSD again.</li>
 </ul>
</dd>
