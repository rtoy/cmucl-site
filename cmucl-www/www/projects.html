@@HEADING(improvements to CMUCL)

<p> Here is a (partial) list of projects which are either underway, or
    would be useful to CMUCL users. Please join the cmucl-imp <a href =
    "support.html">mailing list</a> if you are interested in
    contributing to one of these projects. </p>

<ul>
<li> Searching for, and resolving, any remaining divergences from the ANSI
     Common Lisp specification (many of which have been fixed during the
     year 2002). The ansi-test suite in <a href =
     "http://clocc.sf.net/">CLOCC</a>, and the test suite included with the
     GCL source code, are useful for this. </li>

<li> Peter Van Eynde is working on changing CMUCL's memory management
     so that it can allocate memory lazily, thus overcoming the
     overcommiting problem on recent linux kernels. </li>

<li> cross-compile from an ANSI Common Lisp: Bill Newman has developed a
     derivative of CMUCL called <a href =
     "http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> which is
     able to cross-compile itself from an arbitrary Common Lisp
     implementation (currently the only way to port CMUCL to a new hardware
     architecture is to cross-compile it from a CMUCL running on a
     currently supported architecture, which is a delicate process). Some
     of the cleanups made to SBCL could advantageously be back-ported to
     CMUCL. </li>

<li> reviving the HPPA port. </li>

<li> <strong>win32 port</strong>: a few people investigated the possibility
     of using the POSIX emulation layer provided by the cygwin32 tools
     to port CMUCL to win32. Given the problems with memory
     management facilities provided by this library, as well as
     licencing issues, a native port would be more useful. The primary
     issues to resolve are memory management and signal handling. </li>

<li> add <strong>UNICODE support</strong> -- currently CMUCL only supports
     octet-sized characters. Requires changes to the streams and
     sequence handling functions. There is Brian Spilsbury's
     experimental <a
     href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/experimental/cmucl-unicode-2002-10-05-x86-linux.tar.bz2">unicode
     effort</a> with some support for locales and dialects.  There is
     also a new effort on unicode support.</li>

<li> add 64-bit support. CMUCL currently only works with 32 bit addresses,
     even on platforms like UltraSPARC, which could support 64-bit
     applications. Raymond Toy is thinking about how to approach this
     problem. </li>

<li> add a peephole optimizer to the CMUCL assembler, to remove useless
     bits of the instruction stream. </li>

<li> Porting multiprocessing to other
     platforms than x86. This requires knowledge of assembly and of the
     internals of CMUCL. </li>

<li> Write a soft-real-time garbage collector for CMUCL, for applications
     such as games where bounded response time is very important. </li>

<li> improving Garnet: the Garnet user-interface toolkit is no longer
     maintained by the CMU Interfaces group which developed it. There are
     always bugfixes to integrate in the code and improvements to add. Fred
     Gilham is looking after this. </li>

<li> Allow PCL to emit LAP bytecode, instead of calling the compiler at
     runtime. This would allow small CLOS-enabled CMUCL images to be built.
     (Currently, it is possible to build quite small &quot;runtime&quot;
     images without the compiler, but these cannot be built with CLOS
     support, because PCL requires the compiler to be present at runtime.)
     </li>

<li> The <a href="http://mcclim.cliki.net/">McCLIM project</a> aims to
     produce a free version of the CLIM user-interface specification. It
     would make a good subtrate for sophisticated interactors, browsers and
     code navigation tools. </li>

<li> A port to the <a href = "http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">
     Flux OSKit</a>, to produce CMUCL-OS. </li>

</ul>
