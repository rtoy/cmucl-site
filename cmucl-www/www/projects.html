          <strong>Projects</strong>: improvements to CMUCL
        </div>
        <p>
          Here is a (partial) list of projects which are either underway, or
          would be useful to CMUCL users. Please join the cmucl-imp <a href=
          "support.html">mailing list</a> if you are interested in contributing
          to one of these projects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Searching for, and resolving, any remaining divergences from the
          ANSI Common Lisp specification (many of which have been fixed during
          the year 2002). The ansi-test suite in <a href=
          "http://clocc.sf.net/">CLOCC</a>, and the test suite included with
          the GCL source code, are useful for this.
          </li>
          <li>Peter Van Eynde is working on changing CMUCL's memory management
          so that it can allocate memory lazily, thus overcoming the
          overcommiting problem on recent linux kernels.
          </li>
          <li>cross-compile from an ANSI Common Lisp: Bill Newman has developed
          a derivative of CMUCL called <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">
            Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> which is able to cross-compile itself
            from an arbitrary Common Lisp implementation (currently the only
            way to port CMUCL to a new hardware architecture is to
            cross-compile it from a CMUCL running on a currently supported
            architecture, which is a delicate process). Some of the cleanups
            made to SBCL could advantageously be back-ported to CMUCL.
          </li>
          <li>reviving the HPPA port.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>win32 port</strong>: a few people investigated the
            possibility of using the POSIX emulation layer provided by the
            cygwin32 tools to port CMUCL to win32. Given the problems with
            memory management facilities provided by this library, as well as
            licencing issues, a native port would be more useful. The primary
            issues to resolve are memory management and signal handling.
          </li>
          <li>add 64-bit support. CMUCL currently only works with 32 bit
          addresses, even on platforms like UltraSPARC, which could support
          64-bit applications. Raymond Toy is thinking about how to approach
          this problem.
          </li>
          <li>add a peephole optimizer to the CMUCL assembler, to remove
          useless bits of the instruction stream.
          </li>
          <li>Porting multiprocessing to other platforms than x86. This
          requires knowledge of assembly and of the internals of CMUCL.
          </li>
          <li>Write a soft-real-time garbage collector for CMUCL, for
          applications such as games where bounded response time is very
          important.
          </li>
          <li>improving Garnet: the Garnet user-interface toolkit is no longer
          maintained by the CMU Interfaces group which developed it. There are
          always bugfixes to integrate in the code and improvements to add.
          Fred Gilham is looking after this.
          </li>
          <li>Allow PCL to emit LAP bytecode, instead of calling the compiler
          at runtime. This would allow small CLOS-enabled CMUCL images to be
          built. (Currently, it is possible to build quite small "runtime"
          images without the compiler, but these cannot be built with CLOS
          support, because PCL requires the compiler to be present at runtime.)
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="http://mcclim.cliki.net/">McCLIM project</a> aims to
          produce a free version of the CLIM user-interface specification. It
          would make a good subtrate for sophisticated interactors, browsers
          and code navigation tools.
          </li>
          <li>A port to the <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">Flux
          OSKit</a>, to produce CMUCL-OS.
          </li>
        </ul>
