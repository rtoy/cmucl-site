@@HEADING(how to get CMUCL)

<p> The latest formal release of CMUCL (binaries and source) is available
    from the various download sites, in the <tt>release</tt> directory.
    For each supported platform there are two bzipped tar archives, one
    containing the base system, and the other (with <tt>extra</tt> in the
    name) containing additional files supporting CLX, Hemlock, Gray streams
    and so on.  In addition, there is the source archive containing
    the sources used to compile the binaries.

<p> The download sites are: </p>

<dl>
<dt> <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/">common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/</a>
<dd> The primary CMUCL machine, hosted in the United Kingdom.</dd>

<!--
<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.averillpark.net/cmucl/">ftp.averillpark.net:/cmucl</a> 
<dd> A complete mirror located in the United States. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/cmucl/">
     ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/cmucl</a> 
<dd> The primary mirror and main rsync mirror, located in England. </dd>
-->

<dt> <a href = "http://www.pmsf.de/pub/cmucl/">www.pmsf.de/pub/cmucl</a>
<dd> A mirror of the downloads directory, located in Germany with good bandwidth across Europe and the
     USA. </dd>

<dd> A mirror of the downloads directory. </dd>

</dl>

<p> Monthly binaries are also available from the download sites.
    These are binaries that are built at the beginning of each
    month (roughly) and are based on the code base at that time.
    These may differ significantly from the release, because they may
    have bug fixes or new features added.  Although we try to be sure
    that they work and are capable of compiling themselves, they are
    only lightly tested.  Use with caution.

<p> Binaries built from source more recent than the latest release are
    available from the download mirrors in the <tt>binaries</tt> directory.
    These binaries contain bugfixes and new features that are not in the
    release binaries, but have had less testing. </p>

<p> Binaries providing experimental features (such as long floats), or
    built with non-standard features or subsystems, are available in the
    <tt>experimental</tt> directory. These haven't had much testing. </p>

<p> Please read the <a href =

    disclaimer</a> for details of the <em>absence of warranty</em>

<h2>Alternative binary distributions</h2>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <a href = "http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>
    port (<tt>ports/lang/cmucl</tt>) for the x86, thanks to Martin Cracauer. </p>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <tt>.deb</tt> <a href =
    "http://packages.debian.org/cmucl">package</a> for <a href =
    "http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> on x86, thanks to Peter
    Van Eynde. Note that the Debian binaries are not exactly equivalent to
    the cons.org binaries; they include a number of modifications. In
    particular, they are not binary-compatible with the cons.org binaries,
    so you cannot share FASL files between them. You can use <a href =
    "http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">Alien</a> to <strong>convert the
    debian packages into RPMs</strong> to be installed on RedHat or SuSE
    installations:

<pre>
    # alien --to-rpm cmucl-version.deb
    # rpm -i cmucl-version.rpm
</pre>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <a
    href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/name/cmucl">package</a>
    for RedHat Fedora and RHEL, thanks to Rex Dieter.  These are also
    a part of <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Fedora
    EPEL</a>.  These are slightly different from the binaries
    distributed on common-lisp.net.  In particular, different compiler
    flags may have been used, and only the x87 core is provided, but
    that may change.</p>

<p> CMUCL is available as a package for the <a href =
    "http://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> distribution, thanks to
    Stelian Ionescu. The package is named cmucl, and is in the
    dev-lisp category.  These are slightly different from the
    common-lisp.net binaries in that different compiler flags may have
    been used and only one "flavor" of x87 or sse2 is built.</p>



<h2>Anonymous CVS access</h2>

<p> The CMUCL source code can also be obtained by anonymous CVS from
    <tt>common-lisp.net</tt>. It can be accessed using a command such as

<pre>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/cmucl/cvsroot login
    &lt;enter anonymous as password&gt;
    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/cmucl/cvsroot co src
</pre>

<p> The anoncvs tree is available using anonymous rsync at
    <tt>rsync://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/cvsroot</tt>. This is
    probably the most network-friendly way of keeping up to date with the
    current sources, since the rsync protocol is very efficient. Keeping
    your own local CVS tree also makes cvs operations much faster than when
    you contact the main repository. Sample usage:

<pre>
    rsync -avz rsync://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/cvsroot /var/cvs/CVS-cmucl
</pre>

<p> You can also <a href =
    "http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/src/?cvsroot=cmucl">view
    the repository via viewCVS</a>, and access histories and diffs between
    versions.
</p>

<p> The snapshots use tags of the form <tt>snapshot-yyyy-mm</tt>
</p>

<p> There are CVS tags for the latest releases, named
    <tt>RELEASE_19f</tt>, <tt>release-19e</tt>, <tt>release-19d</tt>,
    <tt>release-19c</tt>, <tt>release-19b</tt>, <tt>release-19a</tt>,
    <tt>release-18e</tt>, <tt>RELEASE_18d</tt>, <tt>RELEASE_18c</tt>,
    <tt>RELEASE_18b</tt> and <tt>RELEASE_18a</tt>.
    </p>

<p> Thanks for using CMUCL! </p>
