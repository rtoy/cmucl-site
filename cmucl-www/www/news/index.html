<dd><strong>CMUCL 19f has been released</strong>.  The <a
href="release-19f.txt">release notes</a> and binaries for the
supported platforms are available from the <tt>release/19f</tt>
directory of the <a href="../download.html">download</a> sites.  Due
to the 19f release, no snapshots are available for 2009-03.

<dt>2009-02-09</dt>
<dd> The <strong>Feburary snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots/2009-02</tt> directory of the download sites.

<dt>2009-01-09</dt>
<dd> <p>The <strong>January snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots/2009-01</tt> directory of the download sites.</p>

<p> These snapshots include support for X87 and SSE2. CMUCL will
automatically detect if the chip supports SSE2 or not. If so, the SSE2 core
will be used. If not, the X87 (legacy) core will be used. For special
cases, the user may override this automatic selection by using the
<emph>-fpu</emph> flag. The SSE2 core should work somewhat better than the
X87 core on chips that support both. In particular some round-off issues
are gone, and complex arithmetic with SSE2 is faster and sometimes much
faster than X87.</p>

<dd> <p>Fred Lakin, a long-time CMUCL user, has written a novel called <a href =
"http://www.livegraphicsnightly.com">Live Graphics Nightly</a>. How does
this relate to CMUCL? He has a nice acknowledgement to all of the CMUCL
implementors and maintainers.</p>

<dt>2008-05-01</dt>
<dd> <strong>CMUCL 19e has been released</strong>. The <a href="release-19e.txt">release notes</a> and binaries for the
supported platforms are available from the <tt>release/19e</tt> directory
of the <a href="../download.html">download</a> sites.
