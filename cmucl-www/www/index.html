@@HEADING(a high-performance, free Common Lisp implementation)

<p> CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
    which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
    Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features: </p>

<ul>
<li> Support for static arrays that are never moved by GC but are
properly removed when no longer referenced. </li>

<li> Unicode support, including many of the most common external
formats such as UTF-8 and support for handling Unix, DOS, and Mac
end-of-line schemes. </li>

<li> native double-double floats including complex double-double
floats and specialized arrays for double-double floats and and complex
double-double floats that give approximately 106 bits (32 digits) of
precision. </li>

<li> a <strong>sophisticated native-code compiler</strong> which is capable
     of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed
     with C compilers. </li>

<li> generational garbage collection and <strong>multiprocessing
     capability</strong> on the x86 ports. </li>

<li> a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and
     system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and
     direct access to Unix system calls. </li>

<li> support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
     calls. </li>

<li> an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
     includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol. </li>

<li> a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
     code profiler. </li>

<li> an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
     graphical widget library (Garnet). </li>

<li> programmer-extensible input and output streams. </li>

<li> an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp. </li>

<li> <strong>freely redistributable</strong>: free, with full source code
     (most of which is in the public domain) and no strings attached (and
     no warranty). Like the GNU/Linux and *BSD operating systems, CMUCL is
     maintained and improved by a team of volunteers collaborating over the
     Internet. </li>

</ul>

<dt><strong>Snapshot 2012-12</strong></dt>
<dd>The <a
href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/12/">2012-12
snapshot </a> has been released, See the <a
href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/snapshots/2012/10/release-20e.txt">release
notes</a> for details, but here is a quick summary of the changes
between the this snapshot and the previous snapshot.

<ul>
 <li> ASDF2 updated to 2.26</li>
 <li> Unicode completion has been reverted to the older version due to
 the inability to complete <code>#\hangul_syllable_</code>. Trac 
 <a href=http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/ticket/52"">ticket:52</a>
 reopened.</li>
 <li> Starting with this snapshot, only the unicode version of CMUCL
 is officially supported. The 8-bit version and code will not be
 deleted, but binaries will no longer be supplied for the 8-bit
 (non-unicode) version. </li>

</ul>

<dt><strong>CMUCL 20d released</strong></dt>
<dd><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/release/20d/">CMUCL 20d</a> has been released, For information on the changes between
20d and 20c, we refer the reader to the <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl/wiki/Release20d">20d release notes</a>.

Because of the release, there will not be a 2011-11 snapshot. .

<h2>What is Common Lisp?</h2>

<p> Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and
    <em>explorative programming</em>. The language has a dynamic
    semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada.
    It features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental
    development environment, a module system, a large number of
    powerful data structures, a large standard library of useful
    functions, a sophisticated object system supporting multiple
    inheritance and generic functions, an exception system,
    user-defined types and a macro system which allows programmers to
    extend the language. </p>

Pascal is for building pyramids -- imposing, breathtaking
structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp
is for building organisms ... <br> <i>Alan Perlis</i>
