            A new version of GerdsPCL has been uploaded to the experimental
            directory of the download mirrors. This version includes an
            optimization that can make class slot access as efficient as for
            structures!

            A new GerdsPCL tarball is available in the experimental directory
            of the download sites. This release can only be used with a recent
            CMUCL built from sources after 2002-12-13.

            Binaries featuring the "gerdspcl" version of PCL have been uploaded
            to the experimental directory of the download sites. There are
            binaries for sparcv9-solaris and x86-linux. The gerdspcl branch
            contains a number of bugfixes and speed enhancements that have not
            yet been integrated into the CMUCL version of PCL, but that likely
            will be included in a future release.

            There has been work on reviving the Linux/Alpha port of CMUCL;
            experimental binaries should be available in a few days.

            An updated version of the <i>CMUCL User's Manual</i> has been
            uploaded to the documentation section, in HTML, PDF and Postscript
            formats.

            A tarball containing the revamped source to PCL (the CLOS
            implementation in CMUCL) is available in the experimental directory
            of the download sites. This contains all the changes that have been
            made by Gerd Moellman. Please test that the optimizations and code
            deletions do not break your code.

            The profiler now reports precise measurements of allocation on x86
            platforms using the generation garbage collector (previously, the
            reported information was imprecise). Non-gencgc platforms already
            had precise allocation measurement, and are not affected by the
            change. A new function <code>WITH-SPACEREPORT</code> allows
            breaking up profiling reports into sections. A CMUCL binary with
            this change for x86-Linux is available in the experimental
            directory of the download sites.

            Some Solaris-sparcv9 binaries with the linkage table changes have
            been uploaded to the binaries directory of the download sites.

            The linkage-table feature has been ported to SPARC by Raymond Toy.
            This means that it works on all currently supported platforms.

            A Karatsuba multiplier implementation has been added for bignums,
            which should speed up multiplications for bignums with more than
            512 bits.

            Binaries for x86-linux, x86-freebsd and sparcv9-solaris from
            current source have been uploaded to the binaries directory of the
            download sites. The x86 builds have the recent foreign-linkage
            changes enabled, and the sparcv9 builds have the recent 64-bit
            integer support enabled.

            Initial support for 64-bit integers on sparc-v8plus architectures
            (basically UltraSPARC machines) has been added by Raymond Toy. This
            allows the use of unboxed arithmetic on much larger fixnums, which
            can make certain algorithms much more efficient.

          <dd>
            On FreeBSD and Linux on x86 architectures, there has been a change
            to the way that foreign symbol addresses (function and data
            references) are resolved. An extra level of indirection, via a
            linkage table, has been added to the resolution process. This means
            that it is possible to dump images that contain references to
            symbols in shared libraries, and that image files are no longer
            dependent on the addresses of symbols in the lisp runtime. This
            work is due to Tim Moore.

            There have been a large number of bugfixes, ANSI compliance fixes,
            unused code deletion and cleanup of the PCL code in CMUCL, thanks
            to Gerd Moellmann. See the cmucl-imp mailing list for details of
            all the improvements that have been made.

            The format of APROPOS output is more verbose, showing more
            information on whether each symbol names a special variable, a
            constant, a symbol macro, and alien variable, a macro, a special
            operator, a function, etc.

            The nasty bug in inappropriate code deletion when using FLET or
            LABELS has been fixed, thanks to Alexey Dejneka.

            Binaries for NetBSD 1.5.2 on x86 have been uploaded to the
            experimental directory of the download site. They have known
            problems with floating point traps.

            Some reduced-footprint binaries have been uploaded to the
            experimental directory on the download site and mirrors. These
            include a lisp runtime built without debugging symbols, a runtime
            image (no compiler, no CLOS) and a small development image.

            Updated extra tarballs for 18d on x86/linux. If you use Hemlock on
            this platform you should reinstall the extra tarball; the previous
            ones were broken.

            Fix for dynamic loading in FreeBSD 4.0 and later. This involves
            moving the static space up, so a cross-compile is required to
            bootstrap these changes.
