 <ul>
  <li> Support for internalization/localization added.  Messages from
      CMUCL can be translated, but currently only a few messages in
      Korean are translated.  For fun, there is a full Pig Latin
      translation (done by machine).  </li>
  <li> COMPILE will update the macro-function if the specified names a
      macro.  (Previously, the fdefinition of the name was set.)</li>
  <li> CMUCL now signals a cerror when attempting to redefine a slot
      accessor via DEFUN or COMPILE.  If continued, the accessor is
      redefined, and CMUCL assumes the new definition is usable as a
      slot accessor.  Previously, CMUCL would print a warning and
      undefine the structure.</li>
  <li> An issue with SSE2 and GC hooks has been fixed.  This shows up
      when doing arithmetic with GC hooks that use the SSE registers.
      The SSE state is saved along with the x87 state.</li>
 </ul>

  <ul>
   <li> FROUND is much faster for single and double float numbers.
   This is available everywhere, except for x87 (due to potential
   roundoff errors.) </li>
   <li> CMUCL no longer segfaults on Linux when running on a kernel
      without COMPAT_BRK.  CMUCL will set the personality
      appropriately and re-exec itself.</li>
   <li> GET-MACRO-CHARACTER would return the wrong second value because
      *READTABLE* was always being used instead of the specified
      readtable. </li>
   <li> COMPILE-FILE was generating an error when compiling COMPILE
      forms.  This is fixed.</li>
   <li> A critical bug in SSE2 support has been fixed.  Multiplying a
      complex single-float by a single-float produced the wrong
      result. </li>
   <li> Fix issue where CMUCL does not correctly handle FLETs in
      DEFMETHOD bodies which use the same name as that of the generic
      function.   The generic function was called instead of the local
      function.</li>
   <li> CMUCL would fail to compile external formats if *readtable* was
      not the standard readtable.  This is fixed by binding
      *readtable* to the standard readtable before compiling the
      external format.</li>
   <li> The debugger help messages is updated to reflect the actual
      implementation.  In particular L and PP have been updated, and help
      for the DESCRIBE command has been added</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
   <li>Some issues with FILE-POSITION on unicode builds have been
   fixed.  However, FILE-POSITION is still incorrect for files using
   external formats that have a byte-order mark.</li>
   <li>The error-output and trace-file files are now opened using the
   same external format as specified in COMPILE-FILE.  This ensures
   that these output files can correctly represent the same characters
   as used for the input file.</li>
   <li>The debugger now opens files using the same external format as
   used to compile them.  Previously, the default format was used,
   which would be wrong if the file is in a different format.  This
   resulted in the debugger being unable to find the source
   forms. </li>
   <li>TRANSLATE-PATHNAMES now creates the resulting path to be an
   absolute or relative path according to whether the TO  pathname
   is abslute or relative.  Previously, the result was take from
   the SOURCE pathname, except if TO were absolute, in which case
   the result was absolute.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>
<dt>2010-01-04</dt>
<dd><p>Experimental support for static arrays has been added.  These
are allocated in foreign (malloc) space and are never moved by GC.
They are, however, properly garbage collected.  To create an array,
use MAKE-ARRAY with :ALLOCATION :MALLOC.  Only arrays of character; 8,
16, and 32-bit integers (signed or unsigned); single and double
floats; and complex single and double floats are supported.
</dd>
<dt>2009-10-29</dt>
<dd> <p>CMUCL has a faster unicode reader now.  Tests show that the
CMUCL can process utf8 streams upto two times faster.  A serious bug
in SSE2 support has been fixed.  (The sum or difference of a complex
and a float would sometimes produce an incorrect imaginary part.)

<dd> <p><strong>CMUCL 20a patch 000</strong> A serious bug in the
printer was found in the Unicode builds.  The bug caused '|\||
(vertical bar) and '|`| (backquote) to be printed without escapes.
This <a
href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/release/20a/patches/cmucl-20a-patch-000.tar.gz">patch</a>
can be used to fix this issue.  Of course, the next snapshot will have
this issue fixed too.  See <a href="install.html">Install</a> for
instructions on how to apply a patch.</p>

<dt>2009-09-30</dt>
<dd> <p><strong>CMUCL 20a is released</strong>.  The <a
href="release-20a.txt">release notes</a> and binaries for the supported
platforms are available from the <tt>release/20a</tt>
directory of the <a href="../download.html">download</a> sites.  Due
to the 20a release, no snapshots are available for 2009-10.</p>

<dt>2009-09</dt>
<dd> <p>CMUCL 20a pre-release 1 is available.</p>

<dt>2009-05</dt>
<dd><p>The first builds with Unicode support are available.  These builds
have support for Unicode that is mostly working.</p>

<dt>2009-03</dt>
<dd><p><strong>CMUCL 19f has been released</strong>.  The <a
href="release-19f.txt">release notes</a> and binaries for the
supported platforms are available from the <tt>release/19f</tt>
directory of the <a href="../download.html">download</a> sites.  Due
to the 19f release, no snapshots are available for 2009-03.</p>

<dt>2009-02-09</dt>
<dd> <p>The <strong>Feburary snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots/2009-02</tt> directory of the download sites.</p>

<dt>2009-01-09</dt>
<dd> <p>The <strong>January snapshot binaries</strong> have been uploaded to the
<tt>snapshots/2009-01</tt> directory of the download sites.</p>

<p> These snapshots include support for X87 and SSE2. CMUCL will
automatically detect if the chip supports SSE2 or not. If so, the SSE2 core
will be used. If not, the X87 (legacy) core will be used. For special
cases, the user may override this automatic selection by using the
<em>-fpu</em> flag. The SSE2 core should work somewhat better than the
X87 core on chips that support both. In particular some round-off issues
are gone, and complex arithmetic with SSE2 is faster and sometimes much
faster than X87.</p>

<dt>2009-01</dt>
<dd> Fred Lakin, a long-time CMUCL user, has written a novel called <a href =
"http://www.livegraphicsnightly.com">Live Graphics Nightly</a>. How does
this relate to CMUCL? He has a nice acknowledgement to all of the CMUCL
implementors and maintainers.
