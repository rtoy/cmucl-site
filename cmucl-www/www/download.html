@@HEADING(how to get CMUCL)

<p> The latest formal release of CMUCL (binaries and source) is available
    from the various download sites, in the <tt>release</tt> directory.
    For each supported platform there are two bzipped tar archives, one
    containing the base system, and the other (with <tt>extra</tt> in the
    name) containing additional files supporting CLX, Hemlock, Gray streams
    and so on.

<p> The download sites are: </p>

<dl>
<dt> <a href="ftp://cmucl.cons.org/pub/lisp/cmucl/">cmucl.cons.org:/pub/lisp/cmucl</a>
<dd> The primary CMUCL machine, located in the United States. You can also
     access the same files <a href =
     "http://cmucl.cons.org/ftp-area/cmucl/">using HTTP</a>. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.averillpark.net/cmucl/">ftp.averillpark.net/cmucl</a> 
<dd> A complete mirror located in the United States. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/cmucl/">
     ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/cmucl</a> 
<dd> A complete mirror located in England. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "http://www.pmsf.de/pub/cmucl/">www.pmsf.de/pub/cmucl</a>
<dd> A partial mirror of the releases and ports sections, which should
provide good bandwidth across Europe and the USA. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "http://www.pmsf.net/cmucl/">www.pmsf.net/cmucl</a>
<dd> The primary mirror and master rsync server, but only has limited
outbound bandwidth. </dd>

<dt> <a href = "ftp://ftp.cn.freebsd.org/pub/cmucl/">ftp.cn.freebsd.org/pub/cmucl</a>
<dd> A complete mirror, which should have reasonable bandwidth from Asia. </dd>
</dl>


<p> Binaries built from source more recent than the latest release are
    available from the download mirrors in the <tt>binaries</tt> directory.
    These binaries contain bugfixes and new features that are not in the
    release binaries, but have had less testing. </p>

<p> Binaries providing experimental features (such as long floats), or
    built with non-standard features or subsystems, are available in the
    <tt>experimental</tt> directory. These haven't had much testing. </p>

<p> Please read the <a href =
    "ftp://ftp2.cons.org/pub/lisp/cmucl/disclaim.txt">CMUCL
    disclaimer</a> for details of the <em>absence of warranty</em>
    traditional with free software. </p>


<h2>Alternative binary distributions</h2>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <a href = "http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>
    port (<tt>ports/lang/cmucl</tt>) for the x86, thanks to Martin Cracauer. </p>

<p> CMUCL is available as a <tt>.deb</tt> <a href =
    "http://www.debian.org/Packages/stable/devel/cmucl.html" >package</a>
    for <a href = "http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> on x86,
    thanks to Peter Van Eynde. Note that the Debian binaries are not
    exactly equivalent to the cons.org binaries; they include a number of
    modifications. In particular, they are not binary-compatible with the
    cons.org binaries, so you cannot share FASL files between them. You can
    use <a href = "http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">Alien</a> to
    <strong>convert the debian packages into RPMs</strong> to be installed
    on RedHat or SuSE installations:

<pre>
    # alien --to-rpm cmucl-version.deb
    # rpm -i cmucl-version.rpm
</pre>

<p> CMUCL is <a href = "http://www.caddr.com/lisp/">available in RPM
    format</a> for Red Hat/x86, thanks for Miles Egan. The RPMs should be
    equivalent to the official release tarballs, but may be easier to
    install for some users. </p>

<p> CMUCL is available as a package for the <a href =
    "http://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> distribution. The package is
    named cmucl-bin, and is in the dev-lisp category. </p>



<h2>Anonymous CVS access</h2>

<p> The CMUCL source code can also be obtained by anonymous CVS from
    <tt>anoncvs@anoncvs.cons.org:/home/anoncvs/CVS-cmucl</tt>. The anoncvs
    tree is synchronized daily with the main CVS tree, and can be accessed
    using a command such as

<pre>
   export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.cons.org:/home/anoncvs/CVS-cmucl
   cvs login  (password is `anonymous')
   cvs co src
</pre>

<p> The anoncvs tree is available using anonymous rsync at
    <tt>rsync://cmucl.cons.org/CVS-cmucl</tt>. This is probably the most
    network-friendly way of keeping up to date with the current sources,
    since the rsync protocol is very efficient. Keeping your own local CVS
    tree also makes cvs operations much faster than when you contact the
    main repository. Sample usage:

<pre>
    rsync -avz rsync://cmucl.cons.org/CVS-cmucl /var/cvs/CVS-cmucl
</pre>

<p> You can also browse individual CVS files (these are not outchecked
    source files, but the RCS files!) at <a href =
    "http://www2.cons.org/ftp-area/cmucl/CVS-cmucl/" >www2.cons.org</a>.
    This is intended for mirroring the whole CVS tree using some web mirror
    tool (such as GNU wget). If you want the CVS tree as a whole, there is
    a daily tarfile of the CVS tree at <a href =
    "http://www2.cons.org/ftp-area/cmucl/current/">www2.cons.org</a>, using
    the filename <tt>cmucl-cvs-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz</tt>. Likewise, the file
    named <tt>cmucl-src-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz</tt> is a tarball of the sources,
    updated daily. </p>

<!--
<p> The code can also be <a href =
    "http://www2.cons.org:8000/cgi-bin/cvsweb-cmucl.cgi" >accessed using
    cvsweb</a>, an interactive web-based CVS browser. You can step through
    the source tree interactively and see histories and diffs between
    versions. No delay applies, you access the working sources. </p>
-->

<p> There are CVS tags for the latest releases, named <tt>RELEASE_18d</tt>,
    <tt>RELEASE_18c</tt>, <tt>RELEASE_18b</tt> and <tt>RELEASE_18a</tt>.
    </p>

<p> Thanks for using CMUCL! </p>
