@@HEADING(Reading disassembly output)

<p> The Common Lisp function <tt class="function-name">DISASSEMBLE</tt> produces an
    implementation-specific description of the internal representation of a
    function. Its output is very useful when you want to improve the
    performance of your code, since it gives you an idea of what the
    machine will do. </p>


<h3>Disassembly of byte-compiled code</h3>

<p> For example, if you use CMUCL's byte-code compiler, the <tt
    class="function-name">DISASSEMBLE</tt> function will show you the
    bytecodes generated for your function: </p>

<pre class="code">
  CL-USER&gt; (defun foo (x y)
              (logand (logior x y) (logxor x y)))
  CL-USER&gt; (let ((c::*byte-compile* t)) (compile 'foo))
  Byte Compiling lambda (x y):
  CL-USER&gt; (disassemble 'foo)
   0: 00    Entry point, frame-size=0
   1: 20    push-const #&lt;FDEFINITION object for kernel:two-arg-and&gt;
   2: 21    push-const #&lt;FDEFINITION object for kernel:two-arg-ior&gt;
   3: 11    push-arg 1
   4: 10    push-arg 0
   5: 8A    named-call, 2 args
   6: 22    push-const #&lt;FDEFINITION object for kernel:two-arg-xor&gt;
   7: 11    push-arg 1
   8: 10    push-arg 0
   9: 8A    named-call, 2 args
  10: 9A    named-tail-call, 2 args
  11: 00    push-local 0
  12: 00    push-local 0
  13: 00    push-local 0
  14: 00    push-local 0
  15: 00    push-local 0
</pre>

<p> This is fairly easy to interpret, once you know that the byte-code
    interpreter is a stack machine. The references of the internal
    TWO-ARG-AND and TWO-ARG-IOR functions are pushed onto the stack, the
    arguments Y then X are pushed onto the stack, the TWO-ARG-IOR call is
    executed (leaving the result on the stack), the reference of the
    function TWO-ARG-XOR is pushed onto the stack, the arguments are pushed
    again, the TWO-ARG-XOR is executed, and finally the TWO-ARG-AND is
    executed in a tail-call.

<!-- FIXME what are the push-local about ?

     seems that push-local is like push-arg, but negative
-->


<h3>Disassembly of native-compiled code</h3>

<p> You are more likely to be interested in disassembling functions that
    have been compiled to native code. Understanding disassembly of native
    code is easier if you understand what certain common sequences of
    instructions are doing. </p>

<p> The following function illustrates CMUCL's ability to use unboxed
    arithmetic on values of type <tt>(unsigned-byte 32)</tt> and
    <tt>(signed-byte 32)</tt>. It can also do similar things with floating
    point values. This significantly improves performance by reducing
    consing, and by allowing the compiler to emit instructions that operate
    directly on machine word sized values. </p>

<p> This optimization is easiest to implement inside a single function. It
    is more difficult to apply when making a function call, since it is
    necessary to ensure that the called function is expecting to receive
    unboxed arguments, rather than the normal calling convention. CMUCL is
    able to perform this type of optimization across function call
    boundaries when functions are declared to be inline, with locally
    defined functions (using <tt class="function-name">FLET</tt> or <tt
    class="function-name">LABELS</tt>), and when block compilation is used.
    See the <i>CMUCL User's Manual</i> for more information on this. </p>


<pre class="code">
  (defun foo (x y)
    (declare (optimize (speed 3) (space 0) (safety 0) (debug 0))
             (type (unsigned-byte 32) x y))
    (logand (logior x y) (logxor x y)))

  USER&gt; (compile 'foo)
  Compiling LAMBDA (X Y):

  In: LAMBDA (X Y)
    #'(LAMBDA (X Y)
        (DECLARE (OPTIMIZE # # # #) (TYPE # X Y))
        (BLOCK FOO (LOGAND # #)))
  Note: Doing unsigned word to integer coercion (cost 20) to &quot;&lt;return value&gt;&quot;.
  Compilation unit finished.

</pre>


<p> The x86 dissassembly of the function follows below. The first line is
    the entry point of the function, at address 0x481E0770. This is
    followed by a standard function prologue, which checks the number of
    arguments and their types, and unboxes them (the SAR operations at
    labels L0 and L2). Starting at label L3 are the logical operations (OR,
    XOR, AND), which operate directly on the 32 bit values. Since we must
    box/tag the return value for functions that follow the normal calling
    convention, we test whether any of the upper 3 bits of the result are
    set (the <tt>TEST ECX, 3758096384</tt> operation, where the magic
    number is just #xE0000000). If that's true, we create a boxed bignum
    representation (sequence at label L5). Otherwise we can just tag the
    result as a fixnum with a two-bit 0 tag (and a leading 0 sign bit, of
    course), using <tt>LEA EDX, [ECX*4]</tt>. </p>

<p> FIXME: Explain the fact that the compiler can generate fast calls to
    the no-arg-parsing entry point, that bypass the checking of the number
    of arguments and their types, assuming that code has been compiled with
    low safety.

<p> The code at label L4 is the normal function epilogue. FIXME explain.

<p> The code at label L5 checks first whether the most-significant bit is
    set. If it is, we have to alloc two words for the bignum, since a full
    32 bits, plust the now required sign bit will not fit inside a single
    machine word. If we only have 31 bits worth of integer, we can fit it
    and the leading sign bit inside a single machine word. Since we also
    need a word for the header, we thus allocate either 2 or 4 words of
    storage, (the heap is 8 byte aligned). </p>

<p> The code at labels L7 to L8 is ... FIXME.

<p> While this example doesn't show it, CMUCL can handle unboxed values on
    the stack, so even when intermediate or argument values spill from
    registers to the stack, they can remain unboxed. On x86 platforms, this
    is handled using a conversative garbage collector. On other platforms,
    this is done by using separate unboxed stacks, on platforms that
    segregate unboxed and boxed values in stacks and the register file. </p>
