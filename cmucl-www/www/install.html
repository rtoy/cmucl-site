@@HEADING(installing CMUCL)

<p> This page explains how to install the release tarballs of CMUCL. If
    you're using an alternative distribution packaging, such as
    <tt>.deb</tt> archives, use whatever is appropriate there. </p>

<p> For each <a href = "platforms.html">supported platform</a> there are
    two bzip2 tar archives, one containing the base system, and the other
    (with <tt>extra</tt> in the name) containing optional additional files
    supporting CLX, Hemlock, the Motif interface, and so on. 

<p> <a href = "download.html">Download the archives</a> corresponding to
    your platform. Certain tarballs are PGP-signed by the packager and are
    accompanied by a file with an <tt>.asc</tt> extension; in this case you
    can check that they have not been modified by using GPG:

<pre>
    wget http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/release/19d/cmucl-19d-x86-linux.tar.bz2
    wget http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/downloads/release/19d/cmucl-19d-x86-linux.tar.bz2.asc
    gpg --verify cmucl-19d-x86-linux.tar.bz2.asc
</pre>

<p> GPG should tell you that the file has a good signature from one of the
    CMUCL developers (you may need to fetch the developer's key with
    <tt>gpg --recv-key</tt>). Unless you have a web-of-trust relationship
    with that developer it will warn you that the key is not certified with
    a trusted signature.


<h2> Extract the tarballs</h2>

<p> The release tarballs extract to the following directory structure:

<pre>
     bin/lisp
     lib/cmucl/lib/lisp.core
     doc/cmucl/README (this file)
     man/man1/cmucl.1
     ...
</pre>  

<p>  This allows you to install CMUCL directly under <tt>/usr/local</tt>, for
     example using
  
<pre>
     cd /usr/local
     tar xjf /path/to/cmucl-19d-&lt;platform&gt;.tar.bz2
     tar xjf /path/to/cmucl-19d-&lt;platform&gt;.extra.tar.bz2
</pre>
     
<p> or alternatively, install under a directory in <tt>/opt</tt>, for example
  
<pre>
     mkdir /opt/cmucl-19d
     cd /opt/cmucl-19d
     tar xjf /path/to/cmucl-19d-&lt;platform&gt;.tar.bz2
     tar xjf /path/to/cmucl-19d-&lt;platform&gt;.extra.tar.bz2
</pre> 
 
<p> The 19d distribution is relocateable: the lisp binary will search for
    the lisp.core file relative to its location. This means that it is
    sufficient to have <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> (or
    <tt>/opt/cmucl-19d/bin</tt>) in your <tt>PATH</tt> to be able to invoke
    CMUCL from your shell.

<p> You can now invoke CMUCL: this should display a banner then show a
    prompt (the default prompt is an asterisk).
  
<pre>
      % lisp
      CMU Common Lisp 19d (19D), running on mansuetude

      See <http://www.cons.org/cmucl/> for support information.
      Loaded subsystems:
          Python 1.1, target Intel x86
          CLOS based on Gerd's PCL 2004/04/14 03:32:47
      * (format t &quot;~&amp;Hello, world!~%&quot;)
      Hello, world!
      NIL
      *
</pre>


<h2>Loading subsystems</h2>

<p> To load precompiled subsystems (assuming that you installed the -extra-
    tarball), just use <tt>REQUIRE</tt>:

<pre>
     * (require :gray-streams)
     * (require :clx)
     * (require :clm)
     * (require :hemlock)
</pre>

<p> The DEFSYSTEM facility is not included with CMUCL, but can be obtained
   from <a href = "http://clocc.sf.net/">CLOCC</a>. It may be installed as
   a subsystem by compiling it (using the function <tt>COMPILE-FILE</tt>),
   and moving the resulting <tt>defsystem.FASL</tt> file to
   <tt>$ROOT/lib/cmucl/lib/subsystems/defsystem-library.FASL</tt> (where
   <tt>FASL</tt> is the file extension of compiled lisp files on your
   system, for instance <tt>.sparcf</tt> or <tt>.x86f</tt>). You can then say

<pre>
     * (require :defsystem)
</pre>

<p> to load the DEFSYSTEM facility into your running lisp. 



<h2>Create a site-wide initialization file</h2>

<p> CMUCL reads two initialization files: a per-user file named
    <tt>~/.cmucl-init.lisp</tt>, or a site-wide file named
    <tt>$ROOT/lib/cmucl/lib/site-init.lisp</tt> (where <tt>$ROOT</tt> is
    the base directory in which you installed CMUCL, for example
    <tt>/usr/local/</tt>). It is customary to initialize the <tt
    class="function-name">SHORT-SITE-NAME</tt> and <tt
    class="function-name">LONG-SITE-NAME</tt> from the site-init file.

<p> CMUCL is distributed with a file called
    <tt>$ROOT/lib/cmucl/lib/generic-site.lisp</tt> that you can use as a
    template for your site-init file:

<pre>
   # cd $ROOT/lib/cmucl/lib
   # cp generic-site.lisp site-init.lisp
   # emacs site-init.lisp
</pre>

<p> If you have the CMUCL source code installed on your system, you can set
    the <tt>target:</tt> search-list to point to them, so that the debugger
    provides more information when a CMUCL function signals an error. See
    the commented-out line at the end of the generic-site file. 



<h2>Interacting with CMUCL</h2>
 
<p> The basic commandline interface offered by CMUCL is rather basic; it
    doesn't offer a history mechanism or commandline editing facilities.
    You may wish to investigate using a more powerful interface than the
    commandline, such as <a href = "http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">
    SLIME</a>, or <a href =
    "http://common-lisp.net/project/climacs/">Climacs</a>, or <a href =
    "hemlock/">Hemlock</a>, or (more basic) <tt>M-x run-lisp</tt> in Emacs.
